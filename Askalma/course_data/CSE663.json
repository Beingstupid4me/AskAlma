  "Course Name": "Edge AI",
  "Credits": "4",
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "With the success of Deep Learning and advent of IoT & Industry 4.0, lot more scenarios have been enabled for intelligent handling on data and inference for better monitoring, perspective and predictive Analytics, early fault prediction & maintenance of devices in the field and real- time inferencing right on the edge devices. The objective of this course is to introduce students through some of the latest techniques in On-Device / Edge AI. The focus of the course will be hands on and the students should be able to design intelligence on the Edge for solving the problems in the area of their interests.",
