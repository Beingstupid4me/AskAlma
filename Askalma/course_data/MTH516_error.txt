--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---

Okay, so I need to extract information from this provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I'll look at the Course Code and Name. The course code is "MTH516" and the name is "Analytic Number Theory". That seems straightforward.

Next, Credits are given as 4. That’s easy to extract.

The Course Offered to section mentions PG+Ph.D, so that's what I'll put there.

For the Course Description, it's a bit lengthy but clearly states what the course covers: analytic tools for number theory problems, prime numbers, Riemann Zeta function, and proving the Prime Number Theorem. I need to include all of this in the JSON.

Moving on to Prerequisites, looking at the table, under "Pre-requisite" there are multiple entries like MTH 341/541 and MTH 211. Since it's a list, I'll structure it as an array with these values.

The Course Outcomes (COs) are listed from CO1 to CO4 in the table under "COs Met". Each CO has corresponding descriptions. So I'll create an object mapping each CO number to its description.

For the Weekly Lecture Plan, each week's data includes Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignment/Labs/Tutorial. I need to structure this as an array of objects for each week. Some weeks have multiple COs met, like CO1 in Week 1 and CO2 in Weeks 2-4.

The Assessment Plan section has different types with their contributions: Assignments (20%), Presentations (15%), Mid Semester Exam (25%), End Semester Exam (40%). I'll map these into the JSON as an object.

Resource Material includes Textbook, Reference Book, and possibly others. From the table, there are three resources mentioned: Hildebrand's notes, Karatsuba and Voronin's book, and Apostol's book. So I'll list them all under Resource Material.

I need to ensure that "Credits" is a number if present; in this case, it's 4, so as an integer. COs Met should be lists of strings, which they are since each week has specific COs listed.

Also, checking for missing values: everything seems filled except maybe some optional fields, but the user didn't mention any, so I'll include all provided data.

Finally, I have to make sure that the JSON is properly formatted without any markdown or extra text. Just the raw JSON output.
