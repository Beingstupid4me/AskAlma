  "Course Name": "Probabilistic Graphical Models",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This course will introduce the basic concepts of probabilistic graphical models. Graphical Models are a unified framework that allow to express and manipulate complex probability distributions in a compact and efficient way. They allow to one to reach mathematically sound conclusions in presence of limited and noisy observations. Many machine learning applications are tackled by the use of these models",
