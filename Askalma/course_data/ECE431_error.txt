Alright, so I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me start by carefully reading through the content.

First, looking at the file content, it seems to be an Excel sheet with various tabs or sections like Course Code, Course Name, Credits, etc. The main data is in Sheet1, which has headers and rows that I need to parse.

I'll begin by identifying each field:

- **Course Code**: This appears multiple times (rows 3,4,5,...) but seems consistent as "ECE431 / ECE631". So the value should be this string.
  
- **Course Name**: Similarly, it's repeated in rows 2,7, etc., and is always "Antennas Theory and Design".

- **Credits**: Row 3 has four entries of "4", so I'll take that as the value.

- **Course Offered to**: Rows 4 have multiple entries but all say "UG/PG". So that's straightforward.

- **Course Description**: This is a long paragraph, repeated several times. Since it's the same in each row, I can just include one instance of this text.

Next, looking at prerequisites: Row 8 mentions ECE230 as a mandatory prerequisite, and rows 9-12 are placeholders for additional ones. So I'll structure this as an array with "ECE230" under "Mandatory".

For **Course Outcomes (COs)**, each CO is listed in row 11: CO1 to CO4, each with a description. These should be objects within the "Course Outcomes" object.

The **Weekly Lecture Plan** starts at row 13 and goes down. Each week has details like Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignments. I'll need to parse each week's data into an array of objects. For example, Week 1: Introduction with CO1, Assignment.

**Assessment Plan**: Rows 32-39 outline evaluations with types (Homework, Quiz, etc.) and their contribution percentages. This will be another object in the JSON.

Lastly, **Resource Material** includes Textbook and Reference Book details. Both are repeated four times, so I'll include one instance of each.

I also need to ensure that missing values are handled gracefully, using empty strings or nulls where necessary. For example, if any field is missing data, it should be represented appropriately in the JSON structure.

Now, putting all this together into a JSON format as specified by the user, making sure not to include any extra text or markdown.
