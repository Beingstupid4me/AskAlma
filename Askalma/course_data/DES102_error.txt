--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---

Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: The table shows "Course Code" as DES102 and "Course Name" as Introduction to HCI (IHCI). So I'll extract those directly.

Next, Credits are listed under "Credits" in row 3 of the table. It's a number, so that should be straightforward—4 credits.

The Course Offered to is all first-year undergraduates, which is straightforward too: All UG 1st Year.

For the Course Description, it spans multiple rows from 5 to 20. I need to combine these into one string since there's no single cell for this information.

Prerequisites are listed under "Pre-requisite" with "Mandatory", "Desirable", and "Other". The table shows Pre-requisite (Mandatory) as "Pre-requisite (Desirable)" as "", and "Pre-requisite(other)" as "". So all three categories will be filled accordingly, including empty strings where necessary.

COs Met is spread across multiple rows from 12 to 36. Each row has a Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, etc. I'll need to extract the COs Met columns into an array of arrays since each week's COs are listed as ["CO1", "CO2"], etc.

The Weekly Lecture Plan starts at row 14 and goes up to row 36. Each entry has Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignments. I'll structure this as a list of objects with the keys provided: "Week Number", "Lecture Topic", "COs Met", and "Assignments".

Assessment Plan is located at rows 40 to 56. It includes Quiz exams (40), Midsem (not specified, so maybe null or empty?), HW assignments (40), Endsem (25). Wait, looking back, row 39 mentions Assignments as 40% and Project as 10%, but the actual assessment plan is under rows 40-56. It seems Midsem isn't specified here, so I'll set it to null.

Resource Material includes Textbook (row 48) and Reference (row 49). So that's straightforward.

I also need to ensure all missing values are handled gracefully, using empty strings or nulls as needed. For example, if a prerequisite is not specified, it should be an empty string or null.

Finally, I'll structure everything into the JSON format provided, making sure each key corresponds correctly and data types are appropriate—numbers where possible, arrays for COs Met and Weekly Lecture Plan.
