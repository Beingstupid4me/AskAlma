  "Course Name": "Convex Optimization",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "Convex optimization problems constitute an important class of optimization problems for which there is a complete mathematical theory as well as efficient algorithms. As such they have been usefully applied in diverse areas of economics, operations research and engineering. The philosophy behind the course is that an initial investment in structure theory of convex sets and functions yields rich dividends in terms of a better vision of convex (and even non-convex) optimization problems.",
