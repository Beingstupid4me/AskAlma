  "Course Description": "In this introductory course we investigate the mechanisms of human thinking. Particularly we will explore the basic mental processes such as how our brains let us \u201cview\u201d and \u201cunderstand\u201d the world, how our perceptions depend on our current state of attention, and how our memories and perceptions can change over time with our own experiences. In this process of better understanding the human mind, we\u2019ll discuss language abilities and the mental representation of concepts and schemas. We\u2019ll also look at various actions that people take in different situations\u2014from simple visual illusions, to strategic higher order decisions to grave mistakes in higher-level decision-making. In this context we will discuss how these \u201csuccesses\u201d and \u201cfailures\u201d provide unique insights into the mechanisms of human thinking.",
