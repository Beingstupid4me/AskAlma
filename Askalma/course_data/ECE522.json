  "Course Name": "Integrated Circuit Fabrication",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "In this course fundamental physical and chemical processes will be used to describe and model a range of fabrication processes making up the various silicon integrated circuit technologies. This course covers everything that professionals need to know, from crystal growth to integrated devices and circuits. Both theory and the practical aspects of each major fabrication step, including crystal growth, silicon oxidation, photolithography, etching, diffusion, ion implantation, and thin film deposition will be covered in this course. It is assumed that students have a quantitative understanding of the basic device physics and structure of diodes, bipolar junction and field-effect transistors",
