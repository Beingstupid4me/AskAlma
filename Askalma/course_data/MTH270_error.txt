Alright, I need to extract information from the provided table and structure it into a JSON format as per the given schema. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name. The course code seems to be "MTH2xx" repeated multiple times, but since there's only one unique value, I'll take that as the course code. The course name is consistently "Numerical Methods," so that's straightforward.

Next, Credits are listed as 4 repeatedly, so that's easy to capture. The course is offered to UG students in the second or third year, which gives me the target group.

The Course Description is quite lengthy and repetitive across rows. I'll take one version of it and ensure any missing parts are handled gracefully, perhaps by leaving it as an empty string if necessary.

For Prerequisites, each row has "Pre-requisites" with some additional notes in parentheses. I need to extract the main prerequisite first, which seems to be MTH 100 (Linear Algebra) co-requisite with MTH204 (Differential Equations). The additional note mentions inserting more rows if needed, so maybe there's an optional or other prerequisites not listed here.

Moving on to Course Outcomes. There are CO1 through CO5 mentioned in the Post Conditions section. I'll list each as a separate outcome under "COs Met" and ensure any missing ones are marked appropriately.

The Weekly Lecture Plan has multiple weeks with topics, COs met, and assignments. Each week's data needs to be captured accurately. Since some weeks have additional notes (like *Please insert more rows if required*), I'll make sure to include those as separate entries or handle them by inserting null values where necessary.

Assessment Plan includes quizzes, midsem, homework, endsem, and assignments with their respective percentages. The data provided seems complete, so I'll structure this accordingly.

Resource Material has textbooks and references listed multiple times. Each entry should be a separate object in the array.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure that each field is correctly mapped from the provided content, handling missing or additional information as specified.
