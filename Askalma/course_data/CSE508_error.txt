--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---
<think>
Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field, I see multiple entries like CSE 508 repeated several times. So, the course code is definitely CSE 508.

Next, for the "Course Name," there are consistent entries of "Information Retrieval." That's straightforward.

Moving on to "Credits," all the entries say "4," so that's easy enoughâ€”4 credits.

The "Course Offered to" section has a single entry: "CSE 508," which I'll use as is, assuming it's correct since other columns have multiple entries but this one seems consistent.

For "Course Description," there are several identical lengthy paragraphs. Since the user wants assessment plan values ideally as numbers or strings if not numeric, I can include the entire description as a string here.

Looking at prerequisites, only the mandatory part is listed: "CSE102, CSE201, CSE202." The desirable and other sections have placeholders marked with asterisks. So, I'll list only the mandatory prerequisites in this field.

The course outcomes (COs) are numbered from CO1 to CO4, each with specific descriptions. These will be straightforward to map into a JSON array under "Course Outcomes."

For the weekly lecture plan, each week has a topic and COs met. The user provided an example structure where each week is an object with "Week," "Lecture Topic," "COs Met" as an array of strings, and "Assignments." However, in the given content, only up to Week 10 is filled, but the rest are placeholders or incomplete. I'll extract what's available.

The assessment plan includes quiz exams at 10%, lab assignments and project at 40%, midsem at 25%, endsem at 25%. These percentages will be included as they are numeric values.

Resource material has a textbook listed, so that's straightforward to include. The references are marked with placeholders, so I'll only include the textbook entry.

I need to ensure all missing values are handled gracefully, using empty strings or nulls where necessary. Also, "COs Met" should be an array of strings, and weekly lecture plans as objects within a list.

Finally, I'll structure everything into the specified JSON format without any introductory text or explanations, just the raw JSON.
