  "Course Name": "Wireless System Implementation",
  "Credits": 4.0,
  "Course Offered to": "UG / PG",
  "Course Description": "This course will help the students to design and implement a basic wireless communication system. Starting with the large scale propagation models, the students will study the modelling of wireless channel as a linear time varying filter, statistical multipath models and wireless Digital Modulation/ Digital Demodulation techniques. The performance of the digital modulation techniques in Rayleigh fading channel, and with different spatial diversity techniques will also be studied. Moreover, the course will also highlight the trade-off associated between single-carrier and multicarrier (e.g. OFDM) modulation techniques. . The course also involves a hardware (NI USRP) / software (using Matlab) project where the students will validate the theoretical concept studied during lectures",
