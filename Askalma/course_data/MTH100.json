  "Course Code": "MTH100",
  "Course Name": "Math 1",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG",
  "Course Description": "This first level math course covers basics of linear algebra including vector spaces, matrix algebra, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality, properties of symmetric matrices, positive definite matrices, and SVD. The course is developed with an aim to provide a strong foundation in linear algebra which will be used in the subsequent curriculum by both CS and ECE students. Time permitting, some applications of linear algebra in engineering disciplines will be introduced. The course also attempts to increase the mathematical maturity of students by introducing proofs and mathematical rigour.",
