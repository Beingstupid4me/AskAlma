  "Course Description": "In this course on Applied cryptography, we will learn about the following topics: 1. Security notions, adversary powers, Perfect security 2. Stream ciphers, block ciphers, hash functions 3. Message authentication 4. Public key cryptography 5. Some interesting Cryptograhic protocols Some mathematics will be required, and will be taught as needed. No background is necessary. Interest in mathematics and theoretical computer science is a prerequisite.",
