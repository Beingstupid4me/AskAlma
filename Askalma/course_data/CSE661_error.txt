Okay, so I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Course Name. The Course Code is listed as "CSE661/ DES507" in row 4 of the file content. The Course Name seems to be "Affective Computing," which appears multiple times but I think it's consistent across rows.

Next, Credits are mentioned twice with values 4 and another 4. Since both are the same, I'll use that value for Credits.

The Course Offered to is listed as "UG/PG" in row 7. That seems straightforward.

For Prerequisites, looking at rows 10-12: CSE101 : Introduction to Programming, CSE343/CSE543 : Machine Learning, and CSE643 : Artificial Intelligence. So I'll list these as Mandatory prerequisites since they are required for the course.

The Course Outcomes (COs) are listed from CO1 to CO5 in rows 16-20. Each has a description provided, so I'll map each CO with its respective outcome.

Now, the Weekly Lecture Plan starts at row 18 and goes up to row 33. Each week has a Lecture Topic and COs Met. For example, Week 1 is about Fundamentals of Affective Computing under CO1. I need to create an array for each week with these details. Some weeks have multiple COs met, like CO1 in Week 2.

The Assessment Plan starts at row 35. It includes various types of evaluations and their contribution percentages: Research Paper Discussion (5%), Class Participation (5%), Assignments (10%), Quiz (10%), Mid Sem Exam (15%), Project (35%), End Sem Exam (20%). I'll structure this as a list with each evaluation type and its value.

Resource Material includes both Textbook and Reference Book. From row 47, there are two textbooks: "Affective Computing. MIT Press" and "The Oxford Handbook of Affective Computing. Oxford University Press." References include an Encyclopedia and some multimodal databases and software libraries mentioned in rows 50-53.

I need to ensure that all missing values are handled gracefully, using empty strings or null where necessary. For example, if a week doesn't have any COs met, I might leave it as an empty array, but looking at the data, each week has some COs except for the last one which is incomplete.

Also, "COs Met" should be a list of strings, so I'll make sure to format that correctly. Credits should be a number if present; in this case, 4.

I need to structure everything into the JSON as specified, making sure each section corresponds correctly and data types are appropriate.
