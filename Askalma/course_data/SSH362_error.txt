Alright, I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: The course code is listed multiple times as "SSH362/SSH562". So both Course Code fields will be this value. The Course Name is consistently "Urban Space and Political Power".

Next, Credits are clearly stated as 4. The course is offered to "UG" (Undergraduate). 

For the Course Description, it's quite lengthy but seems repetitive across multiple rows. I'll take one version of it for accuracy.

Moving on to Prerequisites: There's a table with Mandatory and Desirable columns. SOC101 Introduction to Sociology and Anthropology is listed under both categories.

Course Outcomes (COs) are numbered from CO1 to CO5, each with specific descriptions. I'll list them as provided.

The Weekly Lecture Plan has 13 weeks, each with a Lecture Topic and COs met. Assignments vary per week; some have "Assignments" listed, others just say "Projects", "Presentations", etc. I need to extract the assignments for each week accurately.

In the Assessment Plan section, there are multiple evaluation types: Projects, Presentations, Mid Semester exam, Final Exam, and Teaching Resources. Each has a percentage contribution. However, some entries under "Final Exam" seem incorrect (e.g., 25% twice). I'll note them as provided but be cautious about duplicates.

Resource Material includes Textbooks and Reference Books listed multiple times with the same values.

  "Course Description": "This course will enable students to evaluate urban governance practices. It draws on the ideas of 'space' and 'political power' to develop insights into the nature of urban governance and politics. With this main objective in mind, the course is broadly divided in two parts: the first part engages with the concepts of ‘space’, ‘political power’ and ‘urban governance’. The second part, introduces urban processes and events from the urban conglomeration of Delhi to empirically populate and exemplify the concepts discussed in the first half of the course. By the end of the course, the students will be able to develop an understanding of the ideas of 'space' and 'political power', and the distinctiveness of urban governance, especially in Delhi.",
