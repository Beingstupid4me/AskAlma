Alright, I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the course details. The Course Code is "IIIT Delhi January – April 2015 Semester", which I'll place under "Course Code". The Course Name is clearly stated as "Theory and Practice of Engineering Ethics".

Next, Credits are mentioned as "Credits : 4", so that's straightforward. Pre-requisites are listed as "None", so I'll note that.

Moving on to the Course Outcomes (COs). There are five COs labeled CO1 through CO5, each with detailed descriptions. These will be under the "Course Outcomes" section in a list format.

The Weekly Lecture Plan is quite extensive. Each week from 1 to 13 has specific topics covered and COs met. Assignments vary per week but often involve forming learning teams or applying theories. I'll structure this as an array of objects, each with the week number, topic, COs, and assignments.

The Assessment Plan includes Quiz exams, Midsem, HW assignments, and Endsem. All these are marked as strings since no numerical values were provided except for credits.

Resource Material has two books: "Ethics—a Very Short Introduction" by Simon Blackburn from OUP India in 2008, and "Engineering Ethics" by Charles Fledermann from Prentice Hall in 2011. These will be listed under "Resource Material".

I need to ensure that all missing values are represented as empty strings or nulls where necessary. Also, the JSON should not include any markdown formatting, just plain JSON.

Finally, I'll make sure each section is correctly labeled and nested within the main JSON object without any introductory text.
