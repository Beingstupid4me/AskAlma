  "Course Name": "Combinatorial Optimization",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG+PG",
  "Course Description": "Combinatorial Optimization studies the structures and algorithms underlying discrete optimization problems. A central role in combinatorial optimization is played by polyhedral techniques, namely the representation of combinatorial problems as optimization problems over polyhedra or convex bodies and using the geometry to give insight into the combinatorial problems. The course will be a mix of basic and advanced topics in this area.",
