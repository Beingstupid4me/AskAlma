Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed table from an Excel file containing various aspects of a course, such as its code, name, credits, prerequisites, outcomes, weekly lecture plans, assessment plan, and resource materials. My task is to extract this information into a specific JSON format.

First, I'll start by identifying each section in the table:

1. **Course Code**: This seems to be "MTH302" as it's repeated across multiple rows.
2. **Course Name**: The name consistently appears as "Algebra."
3. **Credits**: The value here is "4," which is a number, so I'll keep it as such.
4. **Course Offered To**: This is listed as "UG+PG" for all entries.
5. **Course Description**: A lengthy paragraph that describes the course content and objectives.

Next, looking at the prerequisites:

- Mandatory: "MTH 100 or equivalent (Linear Algebra)"
- Desirable: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided data; perhaps it's implied from context but not present here.
- Other: No additional information is given beyond what's mandatory.

Moving on to Course Outcomes (COs):

Each CO is labeled as CO1, CO2, etc., with corresponding descriptions. These need to be mapped into a JSON array under the "COs Met" key.

The Weekly Lecture Plan section has multiple weeks, each detailing the lecture topic and COs met. This will form an array of objects within the JSON structure.

For the Assessment Plan:

- Quizzes contribute 30%.
- Minor contributes 0.3 (which is likely a typo for 30%, but I'll keep it as provided).
- Major contributes 40%.

The remaining evaluation types are indicated with placeholders, so they can be left empty or set to null.

Resource Material includes textbooks and reference books. Each entry has the same details, which will be structured accordingly in JSON.

Putting this all together, I need to ensure that each field is correctly mapped and data types are consistentâ€”numbers should remain numbers, strings as strings, etc. Missing values should be represented as empty strings or nulls where appropriate.
