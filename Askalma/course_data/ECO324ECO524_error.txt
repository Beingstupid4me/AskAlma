Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field. In the table, under column 4 (Unnamed: 3), there are two entries: ECO324/524 and another one which is incomplete. I'll take the first complete entry as the course code.

Next, the "Course Name" seems to be consistent across rows in column 5 (Unnamed: 4). It's both "Spatial Statistics and Spatial Econometrics," so that should be straightforward.

For "Credits," looking at row 3 (Unnamed: 2), it says 4. I'll note that as a number since credits are numeric.

Moving on to "Course Offered to." In the same row, it mentions UG/PG for both entries, so I'll list those as is.

The "Course Description" spans multiple rows from 5 onwards (Unnamed: 1). It's quite lengthy and seems to repeat information. Since it's a description, I can take this entire text as the value, ensuring proper formatting with quotes.

Now, looking at the prerequisites. In row 8 (Unnamed: 7), there are entries under "Pre-requisite (Mandatory)" and others. The mandatory one is "Econometrics I (ECO321)." So that's my prerequisite.

For course outcomes, rows 10 to 15 show verbs like "Understand," "Utilize," etc., which are good for the COs met array.

The weekly lecture plan starts at row 14. Each week has a topic and COs met. I'll extract each week's data into an object with Week, Lecture Topic, COs Met (as an array), and Assignments. Some weeks have multiple assignments or projects listed in parentheses, so I'll split those into separate objects.

The assessment plan includes quizzes, midsem, etc., which are straightforward to map.

Resource material has two entries: a textbook by Cressie and two books on spatial econometrics.

I need to ensure all missing values are handled gracefully, using empty strings or nulls where necessary. Also, make sure numeric fields like credits are numbers in the JSON, not strings.

Finally, I'll structure everything into the specified JSON format without any markdown or introductory text.

  "Course Description": "The purpose of this course is to introduce the standard spatial- analytic framework for analyzing spatial data and its target audience are social scientists and engineers. In the past decade or so, much interest has grown in the area due to readily-available spatially-delineated data, particularly when in 2008 the U.S. Geological Survey stopped charging for its high-resolution LANDSAT archive. However, spatial data and spatial relationships necessitate the use of analytic tools beyond the standard statistical methods such as OLS. The role of spatial autocorrelation (also known as multidimensional autocorrelation) in spatial datasets is a focus of this course. In addition, we will ask: how and why does spatial autocorrelation arise; how is it measured and understood; how does it relate to issues of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence; and how these factors inform the specification and estimation of regression models. Specific modeling techniques include spatial autocorrelation measures (Moran's I, Geary's C), spatial regression models.",
