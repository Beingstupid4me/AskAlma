  "Course Code": "ECE611",
  "Course Name": "Memory Design and Test",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This circuit design course brings students face to face with the challenges in designing a Memory Block. The course will introduce the challenges in designing the most commonly used 6T SRAM cell and then the peripheral circuits like sense amplifiers, decoders, write drivers etc. The course then introduces the cache hierarchy. Then the design specificities linked to DRAM design and NVM Design are covered. The last part of the course introduces the memory test methods, including BIST and test features in embedded memories. A course project using state-of-the-art computer aided design (CAD) tools in VLSI gives students hands-on exposure to design in an industrial technology/process.",
