Alright, I need to extract information from the provided sheet and structure it into a JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: They are both "ECE 314/ECE514" and "Digital VLSI Design". Since they're repeated across multiple rows, I'll take them once.

Credits are straightforwardâ€”4 units. 

For the Offering to, it's listed as UG/PG for all rows, so that's consistent.

The Course Description is quite lengthy and repetitive. It seems like a single string with line breaks, but in JSON, strings can handle newlines without issues. I'll include it as-is.

Prerequisites: The Mandatory part is "Knowledge of digital logic, basic computer organization and some understanding of RC circuits." There's also a note about additional rows if needed, so maybe there are more prerequisites elsewhere, but they aren't provided here.

For Course Outcomes (COs), each CO1 to CO5 has specific descriptions. I'll list them as an array with keys "CO1" through "CO5".

The Weekly Lecture Plan is structured in a table format. Each week's data needs to be converted into JSON objects within an array. The columns are Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignments/Labs/Tutorials. I'll map each row accordingly.

Assessment Plan includes types of evaluations like Mid-sem, Homework, Quiz, End-sem, Laboratory, and Project with their respective percentages. These can be listed as objects in an array.

Resource Material has Textbook and Reference Book details, both pointing to the same authors and publisher. I'll structure this as a list with two objects.

I need to ensure all values are correctly formatted: numbers remain numeric where possible, strings stay as strings. Missing values should be represented as empty strings or nulls if necessary, but in this case, most data is present.

Now, putting it all together into the JSON structure without any markdown or additional explanations.
