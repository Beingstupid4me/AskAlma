  "Course Code": "MTH343/543",
  "Course Name": "Introduction to Dynamical Systems",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "Dynamical systems is the mathematical formalism that describes the time evolution of a point in an appropriate space. This formalism has lead to the development of a rich theory which is of interest to both pure and applied mathematicians as it has found application in physics, biology, chemistry and several branches of engineering. This course starts with a systematic study of features and mechanisms dictating behaviour of 1-D dynamical systems (bifurcation, transitivity, periodic points, Devaney chaos) and their application to well known examples (logistic family, tent map, shift map, etc). The second half of the course is dedicated to the study of phenomena from dynamical systems of dimension greater than one. It discusses applications of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, concept of hyperbolicity, Lotka-Volterra equations, and time permitting symbolic dynamical systems.",

  "Course Outcomes": {
    "CO1": "Students can define the basic features (attractor, repeller, periodic points, etc) of a dynamical systems. They can construct example demonstrating those features.",
    "CO2": "Students can explain the behaviour changes of a 1-D dynamical system with change in parameter using the logistic family.",
    "CO3": "Students can explain various notions adding to the complexity of a dynamical system. They can use standard mechanisms to identify those behaviours in popular examples of 1D dynamical systems.",
    "CO4": "Students can explain different types of complex behaviors arising in discrete time dynamical systems in dimensions greater than 1. They will be able to apply those notions."
