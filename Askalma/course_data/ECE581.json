  "Course Description": "The goal of this course is to provide hands-on-experience in implementing several modules of autonomous driving through software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop. This is a project-based course and covers modules on perception, path planning, and vehicle control for autonomous driving. The course is mainly designed towards implementation and hence intensive programming is involved in C++ or Python. The course will use Mahindra e20 and auto-rickshaw as the hardware testbeds.",
