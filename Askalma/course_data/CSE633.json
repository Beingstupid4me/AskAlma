  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": [
    "UG",
    "PG"
  ],
  "Course Description": "This course will provide a comprehensive knowledge in robotics from theory to implementation. The course will cover fundamental concepts related to mathematical modelling, path planning and control of various robotic systems including robot manipulators, ground robots and drones. We will use several software platforms like Simulink, Matlab Robotics Toolbox, ROS and Gezebo for simulations and projects. Further hardware demos will be shown using Qbot 2e (ground robot), 3dr solo (drone) and rotary inverted pendulum (robot arm) available in control lab.",
