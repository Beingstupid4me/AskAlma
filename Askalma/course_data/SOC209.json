  "Course Description": "Rising consumption levels is a key aspect of contemporary societies. \u201cWe live in a consumer society\u201d is a phrase we come across very often. This statement points towards the disproportionate significance of material possessions, consumer goods and services in modern societies and the power of money to \u201cbuy it all\u201d. Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, the media we consume, the technologies we use and the health and educational services we get, consumption pervades our everyday lives and practices. Is shopping only a frivolous activity? Do people claim identities through commodities? What is modern consumption based on- needs or wants? The course on Consumer Culture and Society will make students re-think of themselves less as citizens and more as consumers. Emphasis in this course will be on understanding consumption practices by embedding them within their social, cultural, and economic contexts. Both the positive and negative impacts of consumerism on individuals and societies will be interrogated. Lectures will be complimented through field-based activities where students will examine consumption places and spaces (shopping malls, local markets, advertisements and e-stores) to understand what all (in addition to the actual product) is being sold \u2013 an image, a lifestyle, a status symbol, a body type, modernity etc.. Using specific consumption domains like food, fashion, media/entertainment technology and intimate relations the course will make the learners engage with ideas of liberation, choice, identity, status, inequality, lifestyle, freedom, signification, and power. Further, critiques of consumerism and their linkages with \u2018big issues\u2019 of consumer protests and environmental degradation will also be discussed.",
