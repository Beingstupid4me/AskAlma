  "Course Code": "MTH 201",
  "Course Name": "Probability and Statistics",
  "Credits": "4",
  "Course Offered to": "UG - First year",
  "Course Description": "The course introduces students to probability theory and how it can be applied to statistical problems. They learn about probabilistic models that occur in common applications. They are introduced to probability mass and density functions and statistics like expectation, correlation, and covariance. This is followed by an introduction to sampling statistics like the sample mean and variance, statistical hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation.",

  "Course Outcomes": {
    "CO1": "Students are able to derive first and second order statistics, conditional PDF(s) and PMF(s), of common random variables and functions of the same.",
    "CO2": "Students are able to apply commonly found discrete and continuous state probabilistic models to various applications, as captured by word problems.",
    "CO3": "Students are able to derive properties of the sample mean and variance of samples from a normal population.",
    "CO4": "Students are able to derive estimates of the parameters of common probability distributions and test hypothesis from random samples.",
    "CO5": "Students are able to perform MATLAB (or equivalent) experiments to present data, generate data from distributions, calculate various statistics, and demonstrate basic hypothesis testing."
