  "Course Code": "MTH546",
  "Course Name": "Measure and probability theory",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "The first half of this course will consists of topics from measure theory, which can be considered to be a branch of mathematical analysis dealing with the foundations required to associate a notion of measure (such as volume) to subsets of a set. This study provides foundational tools for many areas of mathematics, such as Riemannian geometry, probability theory, functional analysis, dynamical systems, etc. As a specific application, we revisit probability theory using the framework of measure theory in the second half of the course.",
