Alright, I'm trying to help this user extract information from a provided text file and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me break down what they need.

First, looking at the JSON template they provided, I see several keys like "Course Code", "Course Name", "Credits", etc., each with their own structures. My task is to map the information from the given table1 content into these keys correctly.

Starting with the Course Code and Course Name: The first non-empty cell under "Unnamed: 1" is "New Media and Politics". So, I'll set "Course Name" to that string.

Next, Credits are listed as 4 in row 3. That's straightforward; I'll assign "4" directly.

For the course offered to, it says UG multiple times, so "UG" makes sense for the value.

The Course Description is quite lengthy and repetitive. It seems like a detailed explanation of the course content. Since it's provided multiple times, perhaps it should be included as-is in the "Course Description" field without any changes.

Looking at prerequisites: The table shows "Pre-requisite (Mandatory)" with nothing inside, so that field will be null or an empty string.

For Course Outcomes (COs), there are five CO1 to CO5. Each is listed twice, but I think the last one should be unique. Maybe it's a typo and should be CO5 only once. So, I'll list them as CO1: ..., CO2: ..., CO3: ..., CO4: ..., CO5: ... each with their respective descriptions.

The Weekly Lecture Plan has 13 weeks, each with a lecture topic and COs met. I need to extract the week number, topic, and COs into an array of objects. Each COs met should be an array of strings like ["CO1", "CO2"] etc.

Assessment Plan includes Quiz exams, Midsem, HW assignments, Endsem. The text mentions quizzes assigned as 20%, mid-term as 20%, policy review as 20%, and quiz as another 20%. Wait, that adds up to more than 100%, which might be a mistake. Also, the End-sem is mentioned with an asterisk, so I'll include it but note its unclear status.

Resource Material includes two textbooks: "Populism and the Media" by Luca Manucci and another by Ralph Schroeder. The third resource seems incomplete ("Also by same author..."), so maybe just include the first two full titles.

Putting this all together, I need to structure each section with proper JSON formatting, ensuring numbers are correctly formatted as strings where necessary (like COs Met being arrays of strings) and handling missing values gracefully.

  "Course Description/ Objectives": "Conventional views on the global rise of populism, fake news and extreme polarisation evaluate these in terms of the 'the failure of the neoliberal economics' and/or a result of 'destabilised cultural identity'. But could this have happened without the Internet? This course offers a 'new' media perspective to answer this puzzle, and combines varied explanations to develop macro- level theoretical insights around contemporary politics and implications for policy and regulation. (In PART I) we begin by questioning the binaries in debates around 'hacktivism' which either ignore the difference between old and new media or adopts a heavy ‘technological determinism’ in their explanations. Instead, we develop arguments around the newness of Internet-enabled political action, covering key and historical and technological development relating to spatial nature of new populism ('counter public sphere' Fraser 1992), social movements (Wellman and Raini 2012) as well as communicative power (Castells 2009). (In PART II) we consider several prominent case studies and examples to evaluate these theoretical and conceptual insights. We begin with the 'occupy' movements that spread across the world after the financial crisis in early 2010s, and then analyse the use of new media in the uprisings in Arab world and Asia. Taking a series of case studies we theorise the power of Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp as 'new' intermediaries and analyse the populist trend in terms of the changing balance between the state and society and the slow erosion of established institutions. These cases focus primarily on populist politics but also include new environmental movements, civic activism and digital journalism. In terms of pedagogical approach, and evaluating criteria, our course will rely on active learning that requires all students to develop a strong research orientation and would help them develop independent projects that showcase these insights in terms of policy analysis, journalism as well as technology development.",
