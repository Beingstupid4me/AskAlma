  "Course Code": "ECE577",
  "Course Name": "Machine Learning Techniques for Real-time Control",
  "Credits": "4",
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This course will provide an in-depth understanding of how to apply machine learning (ML) tools for real-time control applications, where no a-priopri data is available for the training phase of the ML component. The course focuses on online applications like control of robotics, aircraft type plants, which can be modelled as nonlinear dynamical systems. The uncertainties associated with the plant dynamics would be learned online using ML components (like neural networks), while simultaneously ensuring stability of the plant. Further model-based reinforcement learning (RL) inspired techniques will be introduced to design an approximate optimal controller. Lyapunov-based stability analysis will be instrumental for designing all the mentioned controllers.",
