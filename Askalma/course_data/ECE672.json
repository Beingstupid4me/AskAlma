  "Course Code": "ECE672",
  "Course Name": "Stochastic Estimation and control",
  "Credits": 2,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This course deals with the estimation of dynamical systems. We will begin with an introduction of probability, random variables, stochastic differential equations, and basics in parameter estimation. These concepts will then be applied to state-space descriptions of linear systems following up to the Kalman filter. Nonlinear estimation methods such as the extended Kalman filter and particle filter will be introduced.",
