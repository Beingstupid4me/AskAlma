Okay, so I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the file content. It seems to be an Excel sheet with data organized in tables. The main goal is to parse this data into a JSON object following the specified schema.

Starting with "Course Code": Looking at row 3 of the table, it's listed as SSH324. That should go under "Course Code".

Next, "Course Name" also appears in row 2 and is consistently SSH324, so that's straightforward.

For "Credits", I see a value of 4 in row 3, which seems to be the correct format for credits.

Moving on to "Course Offered to": The value here is "UG" (Undergraduate), as seen in row 5.

The "Course Description" spans multiple rows and columns. It's quite lengthy but consistent across several cells, so I'll take that entire text as the description.

Prerequisites are listed under row 7 with "Mandatory" being SSH121 Introduction to Philosophy. There's no "Desirable" or "Other" information mentioned, so those fields will be empty strings.

Course Outcomes (COs) have four levels: CO1 through CO4. Each is described in rows 13-16. I'll map each CO with their respective descriptions.

The Weekly Lecture Plan starts at row 15 and goes up to row 28. Each week has a lecture topic, COs targeted, and assignments. I need to extract this data into an array of objects for each week.

Assessment Plan is from rows 30-48, detailing different types of evaluations and their contributions to the final grade. This will be another array in the JSON.

Resource Material includes two books under "Textbook" and one under "Reference Book". I'll list them accordingly.

I need to ensure that all values are correctly formatted: numbers as integers where possible, strings otherwise. Missing values should be represented as empty strings or nulls if necessary.

Finally, I'll structure everything into the JSON format without any markdown or additional explanations.
