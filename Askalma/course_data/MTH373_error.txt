Alright, so I'm trying to help this user extract information from a provided text file and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, I need to understand the structure of the input data. The user has given an example JSON structure that they want the extracted information to conform to. This includes fields like "Course Code", "Course Name", "Credits", and several others with specific nested structures such as arrays for "Weekly Lecture Plan" and objects for "Assessment Plan".

Looking at the provided text, it's a table (Sheet1) with various columns. The first few rows contain headers like "Unnamed: 0", "Course Code", "Course Name", etc., followed by data entries. My task is to parse this data into the specified JSON format.

I'll start by identifying each field in the JSON structure and mapping it to the corresponding information in the text. For example, "Course Code" seems to be listed multiple times under "Unnamed: 1". I need to extract these values correctly.

Next, for fields that are arrays of objects (like "Weekly Lecture Plan"), I'll need to create an array where each object corresponds to a week's data. Each week should include the week number, lecture topic, COs met, and assignments.

For numerical fields like "Credits", "Prerequisites", etc., I have to ensure they're correctly formatted as numbers if possible, or strings otherwise. For instance, "CO1" through "CO5" are listed under "Post Conditions", so these should be objects mapping from "COx" to their descriptions.

I also notice that some fields like "Assessment Plan" and "Resource Material" have multiple entries corresponding to different evaluation types and resource titles. These will need to be structured as arrays of objects with the appropriate keys.

One thing I'm unsure about is handling missing values gracefully, which means using empty strings or null where necessary. For example, if a prerequisite isn't specified, it should be represented appropriately in the JSON.

I also need to ensure that all nested structures are correctly formatted and that there's no missing data. If some fields don't have entries for certain weeks or assessments, I'll represent those as empty arrays or objects with null values where needed.

Another consideration is consistency in formatting. For example, "CO1" should consistently be represented as a string key mapping to its description throughout the JSON structure.

I should also pay attention to any repeating patterns in the data. The text seems to have multiple rows of similar information, so I'll need to iterate through each row and map it correctly into the JSON fields.

Finally, after extracting all the necessary information, I'll ensure that the JSON is properly formatted without any markdown or additional text, as per the user's instructions.
