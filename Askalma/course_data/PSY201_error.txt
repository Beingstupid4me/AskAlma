Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field, it seems consistent across all rows (PSY201), so that should be straightforward.

Next, the "Course Name" is also repeated five times as "Introduction to Psychology." I'll include that directly.

For "Credits," the value is 4 and appears multiple times. Simple enough to extract.

The "Course Offered to" field lists "UG" (Undergraduate) repeatedly, so that's easy to capture.

Moving on to "Course Description," it's a lengthy paragraph repeated five times. I'll need to include this as-is in the JSON, ensuring proper formatting since it contains line breaks and spaces.

Now, looking at the prerequisites section: there are mandatory, desirable, and other prereqs listed multiple times with placeholders for each category. I'll map these into the "Prerequisites" object within the JSON.

The "Course Outcomes" have five COs labeled as CO1 to CO5. The user provided specific descriptions for CO1 to CO4 but CO5 is repeated. I'll include all five, using their labels and descriptions.

For the "Weekly Lecture Plan," each week has a lecture topic and COs met, along with assignments. This section spans multiple rows in the file. I'll need to extract each week's data into an array within the JSON, ensuring that each object includes Week, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignments.

The "Assessment Plan" includes quiz exams, midsem, homework, and endsem. The user provided specific percentages for some assessments (Quiz exams: 20%, Midsem: 25%, Final exam: 50%, Assignments: 5%) but others are marked as '...'. I'll structure this with the available values, leaving placeholders where data isn't present.

The "Resource Material" section lists textbooks and reference books. The user provided five textbook entries, all pointing to specific authors and titles. I'll compile these into an array in the JSON.

I also need to ensure that numeric values like credits are correctly formatted as numbers and not strings. Additionally, any missing or placeholder data should be represented as empty strings or nulls where appropriate.

Finally, I must structure everything into a JSON object without any introductory text or explanations. The output must be directly parsable, so proper formatting is crucial.

The main goals of this course are to acquaint students with different areas contained within psychology, to provide them with some of the major concepts of each area. Basic topics that would be covered would be historical and contemporary psychology, including various perspectives: biological, Psychoanalytic (Freudian), behavioral (Skinner, Pavlov, and other theories), humanistic, Jungian, cognitive, Transactional analysis. Some practical topics like Memory, Personality, cognition, Motivation, mindfulness, Cognitive behavior therapy and basics of positive psychology would also be covered.
