Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field. The data shows multiple entries with "ECE113". Since all are the same, I'll take that value for "Course Code".

Next is "Course Name", which consistently says "Basic Electronics". That's straightforward to assign.

For "Credits", it's listed as "4" across several rows, so I'll use that number.

Moving on to "Course Offered to", all entries say "UG", indicating Undergraduate level. So, I'll set that as the value.

The "Course Description" is quite lengthy and repetitive. It seems like a detailed outline of what's covered in the course. Since it's consistent across multiple rows, I'll include the entire text as-is for "Course Description".

Now, looking at the prerequisites section. The mandatory pre-requisite is listed under row 8 as "Pre-requisite (Mandatory)": "None". There are no other pre-requisites mentioned, so I'll set "None" for "Prerequisites:Mandatory".

For "Prerequisites:Desirable", all rows have empty strings except some that say "None". However, since the user specified to handle missing values gracefully, and assuming that if there's nothing, it should be an empty string. But in this case, looking at the data, under row 7, it says "Pre-requisite(other)": multiple entries with "None", so I think all Desirable pre-requisites are also None. So, I'll set "None" for "Prerequisites:Desirable".

Similarly, for "Prerequisites:Other", since there's nothing specified, I'll use an empty string.

Next is the "Course Outcomes". Each CO1 to CO5 has specific descriptions. I need to map each CO number to its respective description. So, CO1 will be "The students will be able to describe ideal circuit elements and basic non-idealities...", CO2 about Kirchoff’s Laws, etc.

For the Weekly Lecture Plan, it's structured with multiple weeks. Each week has a topic, COs met, and assignments. I'll need to extract each week's data into an object within a list. For example, Week 1: Basic components of Electrical Circuits, meets CO1, assignment on oscilloscope.

The Assessment Plan includes different types of evaluations with their contributions. Assignments are 15%, class tests 15%, laboratory work 20%, Mid Sem 20%, End Sem 30%. These will be mapped into the respective keys in the JSON.

Resource Material includes two textbooks, which I'll list as an array.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure that each field is correctly named and data is accurately captured. Missing values should be represented as empty strings or null where appropriate.
