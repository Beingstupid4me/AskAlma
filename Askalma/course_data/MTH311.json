  "Course Code": "MTH311",
  "Course Name": "Combinatorics and its Applications",
  "Credits": "4",
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "The aim of this course is to familiarize students with fundamental concepts in combinatorics, especially those used in enumeration. Topics covered include permutation groups, linear codes, Stirling and Bell numbers. Generating functions are introduced and their applications are discussed. Applications of group theory to enumeration: Burnside\u2019s Lemma and Polya\u2019s theory of counting are covered. Students are introduced to error correcting codes and linear codes over finite fields.",
