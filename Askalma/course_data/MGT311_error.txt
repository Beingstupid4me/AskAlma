--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---
<think>
Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field. The table shows MGT311 multiple times under column 4, so that should be straightforward.

Next is the "Course Name". It repeats several times with a long description. I'll need to extract just one instance of it for now.

For "Credits", the value is consistently 4 across rows 3 and 4, so that's easy.

The "Course Offered to" field has UG multiple times under column 4, which will be my value here.

Moving on to "Course Description". It's a lengthy paragraph repeated several times. I'll take one instance but note that it might need to be summarized or kept as is depending on the user's needs.

The prerequisites section shows "Pre-requisites" with "Pre-requisites" in columns 5 and 6, so I can extract those values.

For "Course Outcomes", each CO1-4 has specific descriptions. I'll map each CO number to its respective description.

Next is the Weekly Lecture Plan. This seems complex as it's spread across multiple rows. Each row represents a week with details like Lecture Topic and Assignments. I need to structure this into an array of objects, each containing Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignment/Labs/Tutorial.

Looking at the Assessment Plan section, there are various types of evaluations with their respective percentages. I'll create a list here as well.

The Resource Material includes two books, which are repeated four times each in columns 9-12. I'll extract both book titles into an array under "Textbook" and "Reference Book".

I also need to ensure that all numeric values like Credits and Contribution percentages are correctly formatted as numbers where applicable. Missing or non-applicable data should be represented as empty strings.

Finally, I'll structure everything into the specified JSON format without any additional text or explanations.
