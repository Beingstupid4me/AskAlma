  "Course Code": "ECE537",
  "Course Name": "Wireless Communication : Evolution from 3G to 5G",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG / PG",
  "Course Description": "development of cellular standards from 3G to 5G, and Wi-Fi standards from IEEE 802.11a to IEEE 802.11ac. This course will introduce students to channel capacity in non-fading and fading channel conditions, multiple access techniques (including multiple antenna systems), cellular system design, and advanced wireless techniques such as Multi-user MIMO, Carrier Bonding/ Aggregation etc. Lectures will be based on required reading from textbook / reference book sections, magazine and journal articles or supplemental handouts. Active class participation is mandatory - required reading must be done before class, and in-class time will be divided between lectures, group discussions and on\u2013spot presentations. The course grade will be based on class participation, several paper surveys based on the required and supplemental reading, several homework assignments based on the required reading, end semester",
