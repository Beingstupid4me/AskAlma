Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed table from an Excel file containing various aspects of an econometrics course. My task is to extract the necessary information and structure it into a JSON format as specified.

First, I'll start by identifying each section required in the JSON output:

1. **Course Code**: This seems straightforward; looking at the table, under "Unnamed: 0" there's a row with 'ECO221'. That should be our course code.

2. **Course Name**: The course name is consistently listed as "Econometrics I". It appears in multiple rows of column B, so that's clear.

3. **Credits**: Under the credits column, all entries are '4', so we'll use that value.

4. **Course Offered to**: All entries here say 'UG' which stands for Undergraduate.

5. **Course Description**: This is a bit more involved since it spans multiple rows and columns. I need to extract each week's description into an object with the week number as the key and the description as the value. It looks like weeks 1 through 23 have descriptions, so that will be our weekly lecture plan.

6. **Prerequisites**: The prerequisites are listed under "Pre-requisites" column. All entries say 'MTH201 (Probability and Statistics)', which is a single prerequisite. Since it's mandatory, I'll represent it as an array with one element.

7. **Course Outcomes (COs)**: These are listed in the CO column for each week. Each row under "CO" has values like CO1, CO2, etc., paired with descriptions. I need to create a list of these outcomes, ensuring that if any are missing or have invalid data, they're represented as empty strings.

8. **Weekly Lecture Plan**: This is structured as an array where each object contains the week number, lecture topic, COs met, and assignments. Looking at the table, weeks 1 to 23 have topics and COs listed, but some assignment fields are just "A short project..." which I'll represent as strings since they're not numerical.

9. **Assessment Plan**: The assessment types are under the "Type of Evaluation" column. They include Quiz/Assignments, Project, Midsem, and Endsem with their respective percentages. These need to be structured into an object where each key is the evaluation type and the value is its contribution percentage.

10. **Resource Material**: There are two references listed: Introductory Econometrics by Wooldridge and Basic Econometrics by Gujarati. Both have multiple entries, so I'll include them as a list with duplicates removed.

Now, considering the user's instructions to handle missing values gracefully, I need to ensure that if any fields don't have data, they're represented appropriatelyâ€”either as null or empty strings where necessary. For example, if an assignment wasn't listed for a week, it would be marked as "null" in JSON.

I also need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted without any markdown, just plain JSON with proper braces and commas. Each key should correspond exactly to what's required in the provided schema.

Finally, I'll structure all this information into the specified JSON format, ensuring that each field is correctly populated based on the table data, handling duplicates where necessary (like multiple entries for the same reference) by including them once.
