  "Course Offered to": "UG",
  "Course Description": "This course will enable students to evaluate urban governance practices. It draws on the ideas of 'space' and 'political power' to develop insights into the nature of urban governance and politics. With this main objective in mind, the course is broadly divided in two parts: the first part engages with the concepts of \u2018space\u2019, \u2018political power\u2019 and \u2018urban governance\u2019. The second part, introduces urban processes and events from the urban conglomeration of Delhi to empirically populate and exemplify the concepts discussed in the first half of the course. By the end of the course, the students will be able to develop an understanding of the ideas of 'space' and 'political power', and the distinctiveness of urban governance, especially in Delhi.",
