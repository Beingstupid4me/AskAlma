--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---
<think>
Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field. The table shows "SOC206" repeated multiple times under columns 4,5,6,7. So I'll extract that as "Course Code".

Next is "Course Name". It consistently says "Business Anthropology", so that's straightforward.

For "Credits", each row in the credits column has "4", so I'll note that down.

Moving on to "Course Offered to". All entries say "UG" (Undergraduate), so that's easy.

The "Course Description" is a long paragraph. Since it's just one value, I'll include it as-is without any changes.

Looking at the prerequisites section, each row under "Pre-requisite" has "Mandatory", "Desirable", and "Other". The first four rows have "None" for all three categories, so that will be the values for Mandatory, Desirable, and Other.

For course outcomes (CO1 to CO4), each is listed as a single value. I'll extract them one by one.

The weekly lecture plan has multiple weeks with topics and COs met. Each week's data needs to be an object within a list. For example, Week 1 covers Introduction to Anthropology and meets CO1-3. I'll structure each week accordingly.

Assessment Plan includes types like Class Attendance, Presentation, etc., each with a percentage contribution. These will form another list of objects.

Resource Material has two books listed four times each, so I'll create an array with these titles under "Textbook" and "Reference Book".

I need to ensure all missing values are handled gracefully, using empty strings or nulls where necessary. For example, if any prerequisite category had no entries, it would be represented as an empty string.

Finally, I'll structure everything into the specified JSON format without any markdown or introductory text.
