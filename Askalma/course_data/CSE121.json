  "Course Code": "CSE121",
  "Course Name": "Discrete Mathematics",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG",
  "Course Description": "Discrete Mathematics is the study of mathematical structures (objects) which are discrete, distinct in nature. This course provides the mathematical basis for the understanding of computers and modern computation. It is the backbone of computer science and has a lot of applications in cryptography and engineering.",
  "Prerequisites": {
    "Mandatory": "A good knowledge of elementary mathematics, esp. algebra, calculus and basic programming language.",
    "Desirable": "Discrete Structures (MTH210)",
    "Other": ""
  },
  "Course Outcomes": {
    "CO1": "Students are able to read, interpret and write some basic mathematical notations.",
    "CO2": "Students are able to recognize and to construct examples of mathematical objects introduced during the course such as the sets and functions.",
    "CO3": "Students are able to develop several matematical models.",
    "CO4": "Students are able to develop several matematical models."
