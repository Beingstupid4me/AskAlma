  "Course Code": "BIO532",
  "Course Name": "Network Biology",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "The objective of this course is to provide introduction to network biology, an emerging interdisciplinary area which aims at graph theoretical modeling of biological complex systems and its applications. The student will be provided with conceptual understanding of complex networks and their application for modeling various biological systems. Through a combination of lectures, exercises, and assignments, the student is expected to achieve understanding of network biology.",
  "Prerequisites": {
    "Mandatory": "Knowledge of data structures, algorithms and programming",
    "Desirable": "Basic understanding of biology"
  },
  "Course Outcomes": {
    "CO1": "Students are able to explain basic concepts of complex networks.",
    "CO2": "Students are able to explain network models of biological systems (PPIN, GRN, RIG, Metabolic, Ecological and Brain Networks).",
    "CO3": "Students are able to interpret results from network analysis of biological systems.",
    "CO4": "Students are able to code and implement simple network models of biological systems."
