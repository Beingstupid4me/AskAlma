  "Course Code": "CSE 531",
  "Course Name": "Multi-agent Systems",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "The goal of this course is to provide fundamental understanding of multi-agent systems. We will study different multi-agent system techniques for decision-making. These techniques are general and have wide range of applications like e-commerce, robotics, air-traffic control, etc. In this course, we will use multi-robot systems domain as the targeted application domain for assignments and final project. The course has both theoretical and implementation parts. From theoretical perspective, all the major multi-agent system concepts and design techniques will be studied through lectures, presentations and discussions. The implementation component is in the form of assignments and final project.",
