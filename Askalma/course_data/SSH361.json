  "Course Code": "SSH 361",
  "Course Name": "Comparative Politics in Digital Era",
  "Credits": "4",
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "How are big data changing ideals and practice of power? Are citizens more in control of their lives or being controlled by powerful elites? How does one understand the impact of the digital on politics in the non-Western context? This course offers some answers and concepts to discuss these themes by developing comparative and critical theoretical perspectives. In the first part we conceptualize the idea of power and knowledge through a variety of perspectives, ranging from the Hayek-ian and Marxist approach, as well as the widely accepted middle ground of Weberian view on knowledge, big data and its implication in politics. Towards the end of the section I, we move away from the meta-theory to adopt a more infra-theory approach and introduce students to critical framework drawn from the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) which can help us conceptualize 'the digital' in its historical and non-Western context. In the second part of the course we consider the role of 'the digital' in relation to politics of power and resistance in various countries, adding a comparative dimension to theories of digital technology. Beginning with the West and the US in particular, we move to China, Africa and finally, India. In each case, we read analytical and empirical literature that focuses on the assemblage of digital media, technology and social change with a focus on Foucaldian perspectives on knowledge/power, data and surveillance technologies in politics.",

    "CO1": "Students get familiar with themes and perspectives in comparative politics and political theory, and begin to relate these to big data and digital technologies",
    "CO2": "Critically examine the rise of big data from comparative and theoretical perspectives, and be able to respond in conceptual and theoretical terms",
