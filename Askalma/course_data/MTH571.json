  "Course Code": "MTH571",
  "Course Name": "Integral Transforms and their Applications",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG students with instructor consent",
  "Course Description": "The course is designed as an introduction to the theory and applications of integral transforms to problems in linear differential equations, and to boundary and initial value problems in partial differential equations. The course assumes very limited knowledge of vector calculus, ordinary differential equations, complex variables contour integration, partial differential equations and continuum mechanics. Many new applications in applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and Engineering are included. This course will serve as a reference for advanced study and research in this subject as well as for its applications in the fields of neuroscience, signal processing, informatics and communications. The course is open to all MTech, PhD students and some advanced undergraduates, honors students through instructor consent.",
