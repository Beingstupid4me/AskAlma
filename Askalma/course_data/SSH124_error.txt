--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---
<think>
Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field. In the table, I see all entries under column 4 are "SSH124". So that should be straightforward to extract.

Next is the "Course Name", which consistently says "Critical Thinking" across all rows of column 5. That's easy too.

For "Credits", each row in column 6 shows "4". Since it's a number, I'll convert it directly without quotes.

Moving on to "Course Offered to". All entries are "UG", so that's simple as well.

The "Course Description" is quite lengthy and repetitive. It seems like the same description is repeated across multiple rows. I need to capture this accurately but ensure it's formatted correctly in JSON, probably as a single string since it's not varying per row.

Now, looking at the prerequisites section. The user wants Mandatory, Desirable, and Other categorized. In columns 8-13 of row 6, under Pre-requisite (Mandatory), I see "Pre-requisite (Desirable)" repeated in rows 7-9 as well. It seems like there are no actual prerequisites listed here, so all these fields should be empty strings.

For the Course Outcomes ("COs"), each CO1 to CO5 is listed with specific descriptions. These need to be captured accurately for each CO.

The Weekly Lecture Plan has multiple weeks (Week 1-9) with corresponding lectures and COs met. Each week's data includes a lecture topic, COs met, and assignments. I'll need to structure this as an array of objects within the weekly lecture plan section.

Looking at the Assessment Plan, it includes Quiz exams, Midsem, HW assignments, and Endsem. The credits for each are provided in percentages or numbers where applicable. For example, Quiz exams have 20%, Midsem 20%, etc., while Attendance is marked conditionally with a note about minimum attendance.

The Resource Material section lists Textbook and Reference books. Each has specific titles mentioned multiple times across rows, so I'll capture these as strings.

I also need to ensure that any missing values are represented as empty strings or nulls where necessary. For example, if there were no prerequisites, they should be empty strings instead of undefined.

Finally, I must structure all this information into the specified JSON format without any introductory text or explanations. The output should be directly parsable as JSON.
