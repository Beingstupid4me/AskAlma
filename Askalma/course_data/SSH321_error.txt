Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code, it's consistently SSH321 across all rows, so that's straightforward.

Next, the Course Name is "Applied Ethics" in every row of the Unnamed: 1 column, so I'll use that value.

For Credits, the value is 4 and appears multiple times. So, I'll set Credits to 4.

The Course Offered to section has "UG" (Undergraduate) across all rows, indicating it's offered at the undergraduate level.

The Course Description is quite lengthy but consistent. It seems like a detailed description of what the course covers, so I'll include that as is.

Moving on to Prerequisites, looking at Unnamed: 4 and beyond, each row under Pre-requisites has "Pre-requisites" repeated with different attributes. The Mandatory section lists nothing, Desirable also has nothing, and Other includes "UG" since it's a prerequisite for the course. So, I'll structure this as an array with three objects: Mandatory empty, Desirable empty, and Other containing "UG".

For Course Outcomes (COs), there are four COs listed: CO1 to CO4. Each has specific descriptions provided in rows 10-13 of the file content.

The Weekly Lecture Plan is spread across multiple rows starting from Week 1 to Week 13. Each row includes the Week number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignments. I'll create an array with each week's data as an object.

In the Assessment Plan section, there are four types of evaluations: Mid-Term, Response papers, Project, and Class Participation. Each has a percentage contribution to the grade. So, I'll structure this as an object mapping each evaluation type to its respective percentage.

Resource Material includes both a Primary Textbook and Additional Readings. The textbook is listed once with the full title, while Additional Readings are multiple entries, including some repeated titles and notes about additional readings assigned by the instructor.

I need to ensure that all values are correctly formatted as strings or numbers where applicable. For example, Credits should be a number (4), Weekly Lecture Plan should be an array of objects, and Assessment Plan should map evaluation types to numbers.

Finally, I'll make sure there are no missing fields represented as empty strings or nulls if data isn't available.
