Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: They seem straightforward with "ECE515" and "Intelligent Applications Implementation on Heterogeneous Platforms". These are consistent across multiple rows, so I'll take them from row 3.

Credits are listed as "4" in several places. Since it's a single value, that should be the Credits field.

Course Offered to is "UG, PG" repeated, so I'll use that string.

For Course Description, it's quite lengthy and repetitive. The user wants it as a single string, even if it's long, so I'll include all of it without truncation.

Prerequisites: There are mandatory, desirable, and other prerequisites listed. They're in rows 8-12, with "Software programming using C & C++ * Computer organization" under Mandatory, nothing under Desirable, and "Techniques e.g. regression, support vector machine (SVM), neural networks." as Other.

Course Outcomes: COs are numbered from CO1 to CO4, each with specific descriptions. I'll list them all in the JSON array.

Weekly Lecture Plan: This is a bit complex. Each week has a lecture topic and COs met. Looking at rows 13-20, it seems there's data for Weeks 1-5, but only up to Week 8 in some cases. However, based on row 9, the format should be an array of objects with Week, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignment/Tutorial.

Assessment Plan: Rows 20-36 show various assessments like Assignments, Projects, End sem, etc., each with a percentage contribution. I'll structure this as an object mapping assessment types to their contributions.

Resource Material includes Books and References. Each Book is listed four times, so I'll include them all under the "Books" key, even if duplicated.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure that numeric values like Credits are numbers and COs Met are arrays of strings without extra quotes or commas unless necessary.

  "Course Description": "Intelligent computing systems have started to play key roles in many spheres of human endeavor. Their contributions in facilitation and enhancement of human life are following high growth trajectories in various domains. Commercial examples of such intelligent systems are data analytics systems deployed by various corporations (e.g. Facebook, Google), computational finance systems (e.g. automated trading), augmented reality (AR) applications and games, various subsystems of autonomous driving vehicles, biomedical signal processing systems etc. Development of intelligent computing systems requires complex challenges to be solved such that deployment of intelligent computing systems remains justified and lucrative. Specifically, efficiency of such systems is a key criterion for majority of the stakeholders. A high-performance, but low-efficiency, intelligent computing system typically does not ignite sufficient excitement in many commercial application areas. Heterogeneous computing platforms are offering unprecedented efficiency enhancements for many applications, notably intelligent applications. This course will include discussion of relevant key algorithms from the implementation perspective, and equip students with following important skills: - * Understand key challenges and technologies associated with the development of efficient intelligent computing systems. * Implement intelligent computing applications in computational finance (e.g. automated trading), real-time computer vision (e.g. augmented reality application) and biomedical engineering (e.g. automated medical diagnosis) using OpenCL (Open Computing Language) programming framework. * Optimize and evaluate OpenCL applications for achieving high efficiency on heterogeneous computing platform consisting of CPU, general- purpose GPU (GPGPU) and FPGA devices. Skills learned in this course will enable students to better deal with and exploit opportunities created by the proliferation",
