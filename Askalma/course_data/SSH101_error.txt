Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to extract information from the provided table and structure it into a JSON format as specified. 

First, looking at the table headers: Course Code, Course Name, Credits, Course Offered to, Course Description, Prerequisites, Course Outcomes, Weekly Lecture Plan, Assessment Plan, and Resource Material.

Starting with "Course Code" which is consistently SSH101 across all rows, so that's straightforward. The same goes for "Course Name," it's always "Critical Thinking and Readings in Social Science."

For "Credits," the value is 4 every time, so that's easy to capture as a number.

The "Course Offered to" column lists "UG" (Undergraduate) repeatedly, so that's simple too.

The "Course Description" is quite lengthy. It seems to cover various aspects of critical thinking and its application in social sciences. I'll need to include this entire text without any changes except for ensuring it's a string value.

Moving on to "Prerequisites," each row under this column has multiple entries, some repeating like "Btech. CS+SS." Since the user wants prerequisites as an array of strings, I'll list all unique values here, making sure not to repeat duplicates and maintaining order based on their first occurrence.

Next is "Course Outcomes" which lists CO1 through CO5. Each outcome has specific skills or knowledge areas students should achieve by the end of the course. These will be listed as an array of strings in the JSON.

The "Weekly Lecture Plan" section is more complex, as it's a table within a table. Each week (Week 1 to Week 13) has a lecture topic and COs Met. I'll need to loop through each week and create an object for each with "Week" and "Lecture Topic," followed by an array of "COs Met." Additionally, there's an "Assignments" field in some weeks which contains either text or possibly null if no assignments are listed.

For the "Assessment Plan," it includes Quiz exams, Midsem, HW assignments, and Endsem. Each has a value that seems to be a percentage except for "Group project (on Kialo)" which is 30%. I'll need to ensure these values are correctly formatted as numbers where applicable or strings if they include non-numeric parts.

Lastly, the "Resource Material" section lists textbooks and additional references. Each entry under this column has multiple titles, some repeating. I'll compile a list of all unique resource titles here.

I also need to handle missing values gracefully by using empty strings or nulls where necessary. For example, if any field doesn't have data, it should be represented appropriately in the JSON.

Finally, ensuring that "Credits" is a number and not a string unless specified. Since all entries show 4, I'll format this as an integer in the JSON.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section according to the provided schema, making sure to handle arrays correctly and ensure proper nesting for the Weekly Lecture Plan.
