  "Course Code": "CSE622",
  "Course Name": "Introduction to Quantum Computing",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG+PG",
  "Course Description": "This is an introductory course about designing solutions for computation problems using the quantum computing models. It has been shown that these models allow us to solve certain problems more efficiently compared to classical platforms (like Digital circuits or Turing machines). On the other hand, there are certain scenarios where this model is siimlar or even worse than classical platforms. In this course a student will learn about the models and interesting solutions (circuits, algorithms) for some problems from the perspective of computer science.",
