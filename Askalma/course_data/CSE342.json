  "Course Code": "CSE342/CSE542",
  "Course Name": "Statistical Machine Learning",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This course will introduce students to salient topics in machine learning and pattern classification. Fundamentals and advanced theoretical and mathematical concepts related to classification techniques and learning paradigms will be discussed. The programming assignments will provide hands-on experience of implementing some of these techniques. The project component of this course will test the student's ability to design, apply, and evaluate classifiers on appropriate datasets. The application domain for the projects will be from diverse areas such as object recognition, handwritten character recognition, and emotion recognition.",
