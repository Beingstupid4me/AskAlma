Alright, let me try to figure out how to extract the information from the provided file content and structure it into the desired JSON format. 

First, I'll start by looking at the table in the file. The first few rows are headers: Course Code, Course Name, Credits, etc. From row 3, I see that the course code is MTH372 and the course name is Statistical Inference with 4 credits. So, those will be straightforward to extract.

Next, looking at "Course Offered to," it's listed as UG/PG, which means Undergraduate or Post Graduate. That should go under the "Offered To" field in the JSON.

The Course Description starts from row 5 and goes on for several paragraphs. It seems like a long text description, so I'll need to include that as is into the JSON's "Course Description" field.

Moving on to prerequisites, looking at rows 7-9, it mentions "Mandatory," "Desirable," and "Other." The mandatory prerequisite is listed as "Statistical Computation," which should be under "Prerequisites/Mandatory." There are no other prerequisites mentioned beyond that, so the "Desirable" and "Other" fields can remain empty or set to null.

Now, looking at the Course Outcomes (COs). Rows 12-16 outline what each CO entails. Each CO is a separate key in the JSON with its description. I'll need to map each CO from row 12 onwards into their respective keys: CO1, CO2, CO3, and CO4.

For the Weekly Lecture Plan (WLP), rows starting at 14 list weeks along with topics and COs met. Each week has a WLP object containing the week number, topic, COs met as an array, and assignments. I'll need to parse each row into these components. For example, Week 1-2 covers data reduction principles and meets CO1.

The Assessment Plan (AP) includes types of evaluations like Assignments, Quizzes, Midsem, etc., with their respective percentages. Rows 39-42 show Assignment at 20%, Quiz at 20%, Midsem at 25%, and Endsem at 35%. These will be mapped into the "Assessment Plan" section.

The Weekly Lab Plan (WLP) seems to have similar structure but with laboratory exercises. However, in the provided data, there's no specific lab plan mentioned beyond some placeholder rows. I'll check if any actual lab plans are present; from what I see, only row 32 mentions WLP without details, so perhaps this section is empty or needs more data.

Resource Material includes Textbooks and Reference Books. Rows 45-48 list three textbooks: "Introduction to Mathematical Statistics," "An Introduction to Probability and Statistics," and "Statistical Inference." These should be included as objects in the JSON under "Textbook" and "Reference Book."

I also need to ensure that all fields are correctly formatted, with numbers where applicable. For example, credits (4), percentages (20, 20, 25, 35), and COs met as arrays of strings.

Finally, I'll structure everything into the JSON format, making sure there are no missing values represented as null or empty strings. Each key should correspond exactly to what's required in the provided schema.
