  "Course Name": "Introduction to Computational Neuroscience",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This introductory neuroscience provides basic understanding of neuronal systems and their respective mathematical models that describes the behavior of the neurons under various conditions. The aim of this course is to encourage Computational biology students to diversify into the area of neuroscience. This course in not about neural networks and machine learning, but about the use of the tools of dynamical systems theory to understand oscillatory properties of single cell neurons. Nonlinear ODE and PDE models will be constructed, analyzed and simulated using MATLAB to understand different firing patterns of the neuronal systems under normal and pathalogical conditions.",
