  "Course Description": "The objective of this course is to learn all the aspects of design and development of interactive systems, which are now an important part of our lives. The design and usability of these systems leave an effect on the quality of people\u2019s relationship to technology. Web applications, social media applications, multimedia applications, embedded devices, etc., are all a part of this system, which has become an integral part of our lives. By the end of the course, the students will be familiar with the goals, problems and structure of interactive system design process. Moreover, the students will be exposed to the core techniques for task analysis and user analysis. Furthermore, students will be able to understand the innovative features of interactive system and be able to improve existing interfaces by considering these features.",
