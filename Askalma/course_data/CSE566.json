  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This objective of this course is to train students in building mobile and middleware systems that are relevant for variety of domains, including but not limited to, crowdsensing, crowdsourcing, public helath, education, etc. The course will teach contemporary middleware systems in practice and associated technologies to implement them. We will specifically be targetting middleware for unstructured data captured by mobile devices. Computer Science as well as Design students will benefit from in-depth understanding of how Middleware works and as well developing the capacity to develop them. We would discuss middleware related issues for data collection, data privacy, data processing, analysis, and Visualization etc. Students are",
