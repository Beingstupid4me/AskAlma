  "Course Name": "Behavioural Economics",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG",
  "Course Description": "The course will provide a theoretical understanding of behavioural economics, and then apply these theories to do experimental analysis in a laboratory setting. Behavioural economics incorporates human traits of cognition, social preferences, and emotional responses to better understand choices made in a setting that may not seem 'rational' in the traditional sense of the word. Understanding of choices influenced by behaviour is useful in a variety of arenas, including policy making, IO, and finance. Behavioural economics literature also has inter-disciplinary relevance with psychology and cognitive sciences.",
