Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a JSON structure and some table data related to a course on Nanoelectronics. My task is to extract the relevant information from the given content and structure it into the specified JSON format.

First, I'll start by identifying each section of the JSON that needs to be filled. Looking at the provided schema, there are several keys like "Course Code", "Course Name", "Credits", etc., which I need to extract from the table data.

Starting with "Course Code" and "Course Name": These seem straightforward since they're in the first few rows of the table. The course code is consistently ECE517, so that's easy. The course name appears multiple times as "Introduction to Nanoelectronics", which I'll use for all instances.

Next, "Credits" are listed as 4 four times, so that should be a single value of 4.

Moving on to "Course Offered to": This is also consistent across the table with "UG/PG" repeated multiple times. So, it's safe to assign this once.

The "Course Description" repeats the same text five times. Since all entries are identical, I'll take that as the value for this field.

For pre-requisites, the table shows "Pre-requisite (Mandatory)", "Fundamentals of Solid-State Devices", and others. It seems like there's one mandatory prerequisite: "Basic understanding of P-N junction and MOSFET". The other prerequisites are listed under "Desirable" and "Other", but I notice that some fields have multiple entries, which might indicate multiple prerequisites. However, since the schema expects an array for "Mandatory", "Desirable", and "Other", each as a list or null, I'll structure them accordingly.

Looking at the course outcomes (COs), there are five rows with CO1 to CO4. Each row has specific descriptions. I need to map these into an array under "Course Outcomes".

The weekly lecture plan is spread across multiple rows in the table. Each week number corresponds to a lecture topic and the COs met, along with assignments. I'll create an array where each element represents a week's plan, including the week number, topic, COs met, and assignment details.

For the assessment plan, there are several evaluation types: Assignment, Paper presentation, Mid-sem, and End-sem. Each has a percentage contribution to the grade. I'll structure this as an object with keys for each evaluation type and their respective values.

The resource material section includes both references and internet resources. References are listed multiple times, so I'll compile them into an array. Internet resources also have multiple entries, which I'll add as another array under "Internet Resource".

I need to ensure that all missing fields are represented as null or empty strings. Since the data provided is complete for each section, there's no need for defaults here.

Finally, I'll make sure to structure everything into a JSON object without any additional text or explanations, just the raw JSON.
