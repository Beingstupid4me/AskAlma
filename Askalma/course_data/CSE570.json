  "Course Code": "CSE570",
  "Course Name": "Virtual Reality",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "rendering, geometric modelling, display optics, sensors and tracking, vestibular systems and interface design. Advanced areas of VR including telepresence, procedural modelling of large virtual worlds, and designing multi-model interactions and interfaces for VR will also be discussed. This will be a project-based course using game engine based VR development.",
