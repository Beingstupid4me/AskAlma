Alright, I need to extract information from the provided table and structure it into a JSON format as per the given schema. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name. They seem straightforward: "ECE 314/ECE514" and "Digital VLSI Design". I'll assign these directly to their respective fields.

Next is Credits. The value is consistently "4", so that's easy to map.

Course Offered to is listed as "UG/PG" across all rows, which I can take as the value for this field.

For Course Description, it's a lengthy paragraph repeated multiple times. Since the schema expects a single string, I'll include the entire text without changes.

Prerequisites are under Pre-requisites and further specified with "Mandatory", "Desirable", and "Other" categories. The mandatory is "Knowledge of digital logic, basic computer organization and some understanding of RC circuits". There's no Desirable or Other information provided, so those fields will be null strings.

Moving on to Course Outcomes (COs). Each CO has a number and description. I'll map them accordingly, noting that CO5 doesn't have a description yet.

The Weekly Lecture Plan is structured with Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignments/Labs/Tutorials. This will be converted into an array of objects for each week.

Assessment Plan includes types like Mid-sem, Homework, Quiz, End-sem, Laboratory, and Project, along with their contribution percentages. I'll map these directly.

Resource Material has Textbook and Reference Book information, both pointing to the same author and title multiple times. I'll include them as provided.

I need to ensure that all values are correctly formatted, especially handling missing fields by using null or empty strings where necessary.
