  "Course Code": "ECE557",
  "Course Name": "Speech Recognition and Understanding",
  "Credits": 2,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This is an introductory course on Speech Recognition and Understanding offered to undergraduate and graduate students. The goal is to develop understanding of traditional as well as contemporary speech processing techniques and enable students to develop applications using existing tools. Students will be given theory and programming assignments targeted towards solving real-world speech recognition problems. Groups of two or three will do a course project and show a demonstration at the end of the semester.",
