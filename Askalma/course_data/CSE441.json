  "Course Name": "Advanced Biometrics",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": ["UG", "PG"],
  "Course Description": "This course will introduce advanced topics in biometrics to students. The course will involve studying algorithms for image quality, feature extraction and matching. To understand the concepts involved, topics from machine learning, image processing and pattern recognition will also be presented. The projects will enable them to design, implement, and analyze biometric systems.",
