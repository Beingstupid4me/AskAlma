Alright, so I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a JSON format as specified. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name. The table mentions "ESC205A- Environmental Sciences" in row 1 of Table1. So that's straightforward.

Next, Credits: In row 2 under Credits, it says "Credits: 2". I'll need to extract this as a number since credits are typically numerical.

Prerequisites and Post Conditions aren't explicitly listed, but the description mentions no pre-requisites required. For Prerequisites, maybe an empty array would be appropriate. Post Condition is also described in row 5-8, so perhaps that's another section I'll need to include later if it's structured properly.

Moving on to Course Outcomes (COs). In rows 6 and onwards, each CO is listed with "CO1", "CO2", etc., up to CO4. So I can create an array of these strings.

The Weekly Lecture Plan starts at row 9. Each week has a topic covered and COs met. For example, Week 1 covers topics related to Sustainable Development and meets CO1 and CO2. Assignments are mentioned as project work based on field visits. I'll need to structure each week's plan with its details.

Assessment Plan includes Midterm Exam (20%), Assignments and Quiz (20%), Project Work (30%), and Major Exam (30%). These can be listed as key-value pairs in the Assessment section.

Resource Material has Textbook and Reference Book. From row 28, the textbooks are listed as Gilbert M. M. and Wendell E.'s book, and Canter L.W.'s Environmental Impact Assessment.

I need to ensure that all fields are correctly mapped, using appropriate data types—numbers where possible, arrays for lists, etc. Also, handling any missing values by using null or empty strings if necessary.
