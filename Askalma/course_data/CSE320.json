  "Course Description": [
    "The purpose of this course is to develop advanced techniques in the design and analysis of algorithms. It will focus on exploring both the breadth of theoretical tools necessary for computer science as well as the depth through analysis of the related data structure and algorithms.",
    "When taught as a graduate-level course, the students will be required to write a survey paper. Topics covered include string matching, linear programming, max-flow, min-cut, numerical algorithms (including polynomial operations and FFT), amortized analysis, and advanced data structures like Fibonacci heaps, splay trees, steiner trees, skip lists."
