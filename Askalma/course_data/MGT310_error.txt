Okay, so I need to extract information from the given file content and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, looking at the JSON template provided, there are several fields that need to be filled with data from the table in the file. The main sections are Course Code, Course Name, Credits, Course Offered to, Course Description, Prerequisites (Mandatory, Desirable, Other), Course Outcomes, Weekly Lecture Plan, Assessment Plan, and Resource Material.

First, I'll extract the Course Code and Course Name directly from the first two rows of the table. The Credits are given as 4 in multiple rows, so that's straightforward. The course is offered to UG students based on the data provided.

For the Course Description, it spans several rows but seems repetitive. It mentions training students in functional and technical aspects for supply chain modeling with real-world case studies. I'll take this description verbatim as per the first occurrence.

Prerequisites are listed multiple times; they include Computer Programming and Excel skills along with awareness of e-commerce. These will be captured under "Mandatory" Pre-requisite.

CO Outcomes (Course Outcomes) have specific verbs, but in the data provided, it's just CO1 to CO5 without detailed descriptions. The user wants them structured as a JSON array for each CO.

The Weekly Lecture Plan has multiple weeks with topics and COs met. Each week is an object with Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met (array of CO codes), and Assignment/Labs/Tutorial (another array).

The Assessment Plan includes various types of evaluations with their contribution percentages.

Resource Material includes different types and book titles.

Alright, I need to extract information from the provided sheet and structure it into a JSON format as specified. Let me start by carefully reading through the content.

First, looking at the headers: Course Code is MGT310, Course Name is "MGT310 Effective Supply chain for E commerce", Credits are 4, Offered to UG, Description seems lengthy but I can extract COs Met and weekly plans. Prerequisites include Computer Programming and Excel skills.

For Course Outcomes (COs), the first row after that has a list of verbs like "a)", "b)", etc., which correspond to each CO from CO1 to CO5. So CO1 is about explaining basic SCM principles, CO2 on developing supply chain performance metrics, etc.

The Weekly Lecture Plan starts at Week 1 with topics and COs met. Each week has a topic, COs met (like C01), and assignments or labs. The Assessment Plan includes various types of evaluations like Assignments, Midterm Exam, Tests, Project Presentations, Final Exam.

Resource Material includes books and other resources listed.
