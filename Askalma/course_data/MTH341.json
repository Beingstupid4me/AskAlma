  "Course Name": "Complex Analysis",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG, PG",
  "Course Description": "This course gives students an introduction to the theory of functions of complex variables. A function of a complex variable has some remarkable properties which do not hold true necessarily for a function of a real variable. In this course, we discuss many such properties. We do so by studying complex numbers and their properties; analytic functions and their derivatives, integrals and power series expansions; singularities and zeros of a complex function. The course also covers applications to physics and engineering.",
