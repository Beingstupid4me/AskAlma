  "Course Code": "CSE576",
  "Course Name": "Smart Sensing for Internet of Things (IoT)",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This course will introduce students to sensors and sensing systems that are in the 'real-world' and are increasingly connected to the internet and are accessible via web technologies. The objective of the course is to understand IoT sensing systems, protocols and technologies. An integral part of the course will be a IoT project that the students will have to design, build and demonstrate. The \ufb01nal project will span the full research cycle - from problem formulation to obtaining & analyzing results to paper writing. Speci\ufb01cally, the course aims to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to this area, a training in sensing mechanisms, protocols for such devices, as well as an in-depth understanding of networking mechanisms. The course will enable students to understand deployment and con\ufb01guration of these sensors in the real world with a focus on energy ef\ufb01ciency, challenging deployment conditions, routing and data-gathering. A substantial emphasis will be placed on software implementation. All students are expected to learn (largely on their own) how to program (hardware) and run simulations. Students are required to complete a group project as part of this course. This course also aims to train students in the craft of academic research. For this end the students will be asked to critique several papers on IoT. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to read research papers in a critical and analytical manner.",
