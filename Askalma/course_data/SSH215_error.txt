Alright, I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a JSON format as specified. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, the Course Code is clearly stated in row 3: SSH215.

Next, the Course Name is given in row 2: "Nation and her Narratives."

For Credits, looking at row 4, it's mentioned as 4. I should check if there are any missing values later on, but for now, it's straightforward.

Course Offered to is listed in row 5 as UG (Undergraduate).

The Course Description spans multiple rows from 6 to 20. It seems quite detailed, so I'll include the entire text as a single string since it doesn't seem to break down into key-value pairs.

Prerequisites are mentioned starting at row 8: COM 101. Since there's only one prerequisite listed, I'll note that as "Mandatory." There's no mention of Desirable or Other prerequisites in this data, so those fields will be empty strings.

Moving on to Course Outcomes (COs), rows 10-15 list CO1 through CO5 with their descriptions. Each CO is a key, and its value is the description provided. I'll structure each as an object within the COs array.

The Weekly Lecture Plan starts at row 24. Each week has a "Week" number, "Lecture Topic," COs met, and "Assignments." Rows 16 to 30 list these details for Weeks 1-14. I'll create an array of objects with each week's data.

The Assessment Plan (rows 35-48) includes types of evaluation like Independent Seminar, Digital Mapping, etc., each with a percentage contribution. I'll map each type to its respective weight and include "Total:100" at the end.

Resource Material starts at row 51. It includes two sessions: one on introducing the course and readings, another on Week 1-2 lectures and resources. Each session has a title and type (Session and Type of Resource). I'll create an array with these details.

I need to ensure all fields are correctly mapped from the provided content, handle missing data gracefully by using empty strings or nulls where necessary, and structure everything into the specified JSON format without any markdown.
