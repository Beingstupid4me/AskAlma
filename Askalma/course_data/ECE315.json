  "Course Code": "ECE 315/ECE515",
  "Course Name": "Analog CMOS Circuit Design",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "This course introduces the basic analog building blocks and quantifies their performance parameters. More advanced circuits are derived from these basic building blocks. Concepts of feedback and stability are introduced to enable analysis of complex circuits. The course also includes a self-learning lab component in which the students are expected to learn circuit simulation and design tools such as LTSpice, Eldo, Cadence Analog Suite etc. A design project is an essential component of this course.",
