--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---
<think>
Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the course details: The Course Code is CSE660, the Course Name is Trustworthy AI systems, and Credits are 4. These are straightforward to extract.

Next, the prerequisites. In the table, under Pre-requisite (Mandatory), it's Artificial Intelligence (CSE643) / Machine Learning (CSE343/CSE543/ECE563) / Statistical Machine Learning (CSE342/ CSE542). Since there are no Desirable or Other prerequisites mentioned, I'll set those as empty strings.

For the Course Description, it's quite detailed. It starts with studying the need for trustworthiness and covers various aspects like fairness, bias, robustness, explainability, transparency, and ethical aspects. It also mentions algorithms to mitigate bias and explainability of ML systems. I'll include this as a single string since it's too long for multiple lines.

Moving on to Course Outcomes (COs). Each CO is listed with their descriptions across different weeks. CO1 is about understanding AI issues related to trustworthiness and fairness, CO2 focuses on analyzing AI/ML systems for explainability, robustness, and fairness, CO3 deals with the role of AI in human society and trusted decision-making, and CO4 covers understanding AI's role in ethics and safety. I'll map each CO number to its respective description.

The Weekly Lecture Plan is a bit complex. Each week has a lecture topic, COs met, and an assignment or tutorial. I need to create an array where each element represents a week with its details. Assignments are listed as strings, so for Week 14, it's just "Coding Assignment #1". For weeks without assignments, like Week 28, I'll set the Assignment/Labs/Tutorial field to null.

The Assessment Plan includes different types of evaluations and their contributions to the grade. Quizzes contribute 10%, Assignments 15%, Paper presentation 15%, Project 20%, Mid-sem 20%, and End-sem 20%. I'll structure this as an object with each evaluation type as a key.

The Resource Material includes Textbooks and Reference Books. The Textbook is "Trustworthy AI systems" by the course itself, but looking at the content, it seems there are no textbooks listed except possibly in the resource material section. Wait, actually, under the resource material, I see nothing specified beyond the papers. So maybe there's no textbook or reference book provided here.

Wait, checking again: The resource material has "Textbook" and "Reference Book". In the content, after the last row of data, it says "Resource Material", but in the sheet, under Unnamed columns 4-5, rows 12 onwards have various references. It seems that the resource material is covered by those references. So perhaps there's no separate textbook or reference book listed here.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section as per the JSON template, ensuring that numeric values like Credits are numbers and others are strings where appropriate.
