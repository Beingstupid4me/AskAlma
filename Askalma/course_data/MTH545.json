  "Course Description": "This is an introductory course to mathematical theory behind finite and spectral element methods for solving differential equations. Students will get an idea about high order numerical approximations of partial differential equations with applications to complex geometries. We begin with different function spaces, weak derivatives to analyze a differential equation in minimal Pre-requisite (Desirable)",
