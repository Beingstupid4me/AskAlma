Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a JSON format as specified. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: They are both ECO324/524 and Spatial Statistics and Spatial Econometrics respectively.

Credits are mentioned as 4 in two rows, so I'll take that as the value for Credits.

Course Offered to is listed as UG/PG for both rows, which I can combine into one entry.

For Course Description, it's quite lengthy. I need to include all of it without any changes except ensuring proper formatting.

Prerequisites: The mandatory prerequisite is Econometrics I (ECO321), and the desirable ones are Statistical Inference (MTH372). I'll structure this as an object with keys "Mandatory" and "Desirable".

Course Outcomes have several rows, each corresponding to a CO number. I'll list them all in order.

The Weekly Lecture Plan spans multiple weeks, so I'll create an array where each week has its details filled out. Some weeks are incomplete, like Week 13, but since the data is available up to Week 25, I'll include those entries as they are.

Assessment Plan includes Quiz/Assignments contributing 25%, Midsem 20%, Endsem 30%, and Project 25%. The Additional Evaluation section isn't filled yet, so I'll leave it empty for now.

Resource Material has two textbooks: Statistics for Spatial Data by Noel A. C. Cressie and another book on Spatial Econometrics by Luc Anselin.

I need to ensure all values are correctly formatted as strings or numbers where applicable, handling missing data gracefully.

  "Course Description": "The purpose of this course is to introduce the standard spatial- analytic framework for analyzing spatial data and its target audience are social scientists and engineers. In the past decade or so, much interest has grown in the area due to readily-available spatially-delineated data, particularly when in 2008 the U.S. Geological Survey stopped charging for its high-resolution LANDSAT archive. However, spatial data and spatial relationships necessitate the use of analytic tools beyond the standard statistical methods such as OLS. The role of spatial autocorrelation (also known as multidimensional autocorrelation) in spatial datasets is a focus of this course. In addition, we will ask: how and why does spatial autocorrelation arise; how is it measured and understood; how does it relate to issues of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence; and how these factors inform the specification and estimation of regression models. Specific modeling techniques include spatial autocorrelation measures (Moran's I, Geary's C), spatial regression models.",

Alright, I need to extract information from the provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name. From the table, both are "ECO324/524" and "Spatial Statistics and Spatial Econometrics". So I'll extract those directly.

Next is Credits. The value given is 4, but it's split into two rows: one for each course offering (UG/PG). Since the user wants a single number if possible, I'll combine them as "4".

Course Offered to is straightforward with UG/PG.

For Course Description, it's quite lengthy and seems redundant. The user mentioned to use JSON, so I'll include the entire text but note that it might be too long or repetitive for some purposes.

Prerequisites are listed under Unnamed: 2 in the table. They're all marked as "Pre-requisites" with three entries each. I'll extract these into a prerequisites array.

The Prerequisites section has Mandatory, Desirable, and Other categories. Each category has three items: Econometrics I (ECO321), Statistical Inference (MTH372), and another one for Desirable but it's the same as the previous. It seems there might be duplicates or incomplete data here.

Moving on to Course Outcomes (COs). There are five COs, each with specific verbs. I'll extract these into a list of objects with their respective outcomes.

The Weekly Lecture Plan is spread across multiple rows in the table. Each row has Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignments. I'll create an array for each week, mapping these values accordingly. Note that some weeks have missing data or incomplete entries, so I'll handle those by using null or empty strings.

The Assessment Plan includes Quiz exams, Midsem, HW assignments, and Endsem. The values are mostly percentages except for CO3 in the quiz exams section
