  "Course Code": "MTH240",
  "Course Name": "Real Analysis I",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG",
  "Course Description": "This course covers topics in real analysis, single-variable and multivariable calculus, and vector calculus. The course starts with the real number system, then discusses sequences and series in detail. Single-variable calculus is covered in detail with emphasis on rigour and proofs. In the final section of the course, concepts and methods of multivariable calculus are covered but with less emphasis on proofs.",
