Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: They both seem to be "MTH598" and "Numerical Partial Differential Equations". Since these are consistent across multiple rows, I can confidently assign them directly.

Next, Credits: The value is consistently 4. That's straightforward.

Course Offered to: This section lists the same information multiple times. It includes both undergraduate (3rd/4th year) and postgraduate students. I'll need to format this as a list of strings since it contains multiple entries separated by semicolons.

Course Description: This is quite lengthy, but for the JSON, I just need to include it as a string without any modifications.

Prerequisites: The user provided both Mandatory and Desirable prerequisites. For example, "Math I; Math III/Real Analysis I" under Mandatory and "Numerical Methods (MTH 270); Math IV" under Desirable. These should be separate strings in the Prerequisites object.

COs Met: This is a list of COs met each week. Looking at the table, it's consistent across all weeks as ["CO1", "CO2"]. I'll structure this as a list within an array.

Assignments: The weekly assignments are listed under each week. For example, Week 1 has "HW0", Week 2 also has "HW1", and so on up to Week 8 with "HW4". This should be another array of strings.

Assessment Plan: There are two types mentioned—Assignments contributing 50% (with specific breakdown) and Midsem and Endsem each contributing 20% and 30%. I'll structure this as an object with keys for each evaluation type, including their contributions.

Resource Material includes Textbook and References. The textbook is listed multiple times, so it's a single string. References are provided five times, which might be a mistake in the table but should still be included once each to avoid duplication.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure that missing values are represented as empty strings or nulls where necessary, though in this case, most fields have consistent data.
