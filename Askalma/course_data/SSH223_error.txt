--- LLM RAW OUTPUT ---

Alright, I need to extract information from the provided table and structure it into a JSON object as per the given format. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" column under "Unnamed: 0", all entries are SSH223 except for row 4 where it's empty. So I'll take the first value which is SSH223.

Next, "Course Name" in the same row has "Perspectives on Knowledge" repeated multiple times. That should be straightforward.

For "Credits", again looking at the first data row after the header, all entries are 4 except for some empty cells. I'll use 4 as the value.

Moving to "Instructor", the values under "Unnamed: 1" show "Dr. Raj Ayyar" multiple times with an empty cell in row 5. So the instructor is Dr. Raj Ayyar.

Course Offered to has consistent "UG" entries, so that's easy.

The Course Description/ Objectives section is quite lengthy and repetitive. I need to include it as a single string since it's too long for multiple lines.

For the prerequisites, each row under "Unnamed: 3" has "Pre-requisites", which are empty except in rows where there might be more details. Since all other columns have empty strings here, I'll represent Prerequisites as an object with Mandatory, Desirable, and Other keys, all set to empty strings.

The Course Outcomes section lists CO1 through CO4 with their descriptions. Each CO is a key with its respective description.

Looking at the Weekly Lecture Plan, each row from 15 onwards has "Week Number", "Lecture Topic", "COs Met", and "Assignment/Labs/Tutorial". I'll create an array for each week, extracting these values. Some weeks have missing data, so I'll use empty strings where necessary.

The Assessment Plan includes sections like Learning Team Projects, Research Papers, Mid-Term, Class Attendance and Participation, and End-Sem with their respective percentages or conditions. These will be structured as objects within an array since there are four assessment types.

Resource Material has two columns: Type and Title. The values under Type are "Text" multiple times, but the Title varies across different textbooks. I'll create a list of these resources.

I also need to handle missing values gracefully by using empty strings or null where appropriate. For example, in some rows, "Assignment/Labs/Tutorial" might be empty, so I'll represent those as empty strings.

Finally, I'll ensure that numerical values like Credits are numbers and not strings. Since the credit is consistently 4, it's a straightforward number.
