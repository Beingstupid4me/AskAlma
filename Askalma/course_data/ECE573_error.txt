Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the "Course Code" field, I see that all entries under Unnamed: 0 are ECE 573. So, I'll set "Course Code" to "ECE 573".

Next, for "Course Name", it's consistently listed as "Advanced Embedded Logic Design". That's straightforward.

Moving on to "Credits", the values are all "4". So, that's easy enough.

For "Course Offered to", the entries are a mix of "UG/PG" across multiple rows. Since they're consistent, I'll set it to "UG/PG".

The "Course Description" is quite lengthy and repetitive. It seems like it's the same for each row, so I'll include that as a single string in the JSON.

Now, looking at the prerequisites section under Unnamed: 8, there are two mandatory prerequisites listed: "C/C++ programming concepts" and "Digital Circuits, Microcontrollers/Microprocessors (UG level)". The rest are marked with asterisks, which probably means they're optional. So, I'll structure the prerequisites as an array where "Mandatory" includes only the specified ones, and "Desirable" is empty since there's no information provided.

For "Course Outcomes", each CO1 to CO5 has corresponding descriptions. I'll map these directly into the JSON under the "COs Met" field for each week.

The "Weekly Lecture Plan" section starts from Week 1 to Week 46, but most of the data is filled in up to Week 23 with specific topics and COs met. Beyond that, there are placeholders or additional topics mentioned but no specific details. I'll structure this as an array for each week where available information is present.

The "Assessment Plan" includes quizzes, midsem, project, quiz lab, and endsem. The contributions are given in percentages: Midsem 30%, Project 25%, Quiz Theory 10%, Quiz Lab 10%, Endsem 25%. I'll map these accordingly.

Lastly, the "Resource Material" section lists books, datasheets, reference manuals, schematics, softwares, and hardware. Since some entries are placeholders or additional, I'll include them as an array with their respective types and titles.

I need to ensure that all missing values are represented as empty strings and that numeric values like credits remain numbers. Also, make sure the JSON is properly formatted without any markdown.
