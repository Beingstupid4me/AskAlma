Okay, so I need to extract information from this provided text and structure it into a specific JSON format. The user has given me a detailed example of how they want the JSON structured, so I should follow that closely.

First, I'll go through each section one by one as outlined in their JSON template. Let's start with "Course Code" and "Course Name". Looking at the table, I see rows where these are specified. For example, row 3 has Course Offered to as UG, but the course name is in row 2. So I'll take the value from row 1 which is SOC202.

Next, "Credits" should be extracted from row 3 of the table, which is 4. It's straightforward here since it's a number.

Moving on to "Course Offered to", that seems to be UG as per row 4.

For "Course Description", I need to find where this information is. Scanning through the rows, I see that in row 5 and onwards, there are detailed descriptions. It looks like the description spans multiple paragraphs, so I'll include all of them verbatim as provided.

Now, for "Prerequisites", it's a bit more involved. The table has columns labeled "Mandatory", "Desirable", and "Other". From rows 8 to 29, there are entries under these categories. However, most of the rows have placeholders or empty strings. I'll need to extract only those that have actual prerequisites. For example, row 10 says "Pre-requisite (Desirable)", which might be a placeholder for future data.

Next is "Course Outcomes". In the table, COs are listed from CO1 to CO5 in rows 11 and onwards. Each CO has a description starting from row 12. I'll need to map each CO number to its corresponding description. For instance, CO1 corresponds to the first paragraph under it.

For "Weekly Lecture Plan", this section requires creating an array of objects. Each week's entry includes Week Number, Lecture Topic, COs Met, and Assignment/Labs/Tutorial. Scanning through rows 14 to 28, I can extract each week's details. Some weeks have assignments listed, others don't, so I'll make sure to include only the relevant information.

The "Assessment Plan" section includes quiz exams, midsem, homework, and endsem percentages. From row 37 onwards, there are evaluation types with their respective percentages. I'll map these accordingly, ensuring that each assessment type is correctly assigned its percentage contribution.

Lastly, "Resource Material" has two keys: Textbook and Reference Book. Looking at the table, rows 46 to 50 list various textbooks. I'll extract the book titles for both categories.

I need to ensure that all missing values are handled gracefully, possibly by using empty strings or nulls where necessary. Also, making sure that numeric values like credits remain as numbers and others like quiz exams are correctly formatted.

Now, putting it all together into the JSON structure without any markdown or additional explanations.
