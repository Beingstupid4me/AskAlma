  "Course Code": "MTH576",
  "Course Name": "Categorical Data Analysis (CDA)",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "The study of categorical data sets involve commonly used distributions like Bernoulli, Binomial and Poisson. This course involves analyzing such data sets. The commonly used methods like odds ratio and relative risk will be discussed. The multiple regression model building for categorical data will be discussed in detail. The emphasis will be on studying these models on real life data sets and building and interpretating the results.",
