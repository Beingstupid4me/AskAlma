  "Course Code": "ENT414",
  "Course Name": "Relevance of Intellectual Property for Startups",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG (Vth - Semester onwards)",
  "Course Description": "In the 1980s tangible assets constituted more than 80% of the company's total assets but in 2020 the scenario is upside down. Now more than 80% of company's assets are intangible, indicating that Intellectual Property Management is a necessity rather than a luxury. Technology innovation is not merely a disrupter, but a leveler as well- strategically managed IP is a tool for a small company to take on a MNC. If we look at the evolution of contemporary big companies, we realize that one thing was common- they not only did innovation, but secured it through tools available in the IPR System. All these successful companies gave a clear message to the startups that if you don't not recognize and value its creations- it will not sustain in the long-term. A startup is an important tool to transform the value to the society in form of products and services.",
