  "Course Description": "Recommender systems have around for sometime. But in recent times with the boom of retail online trade recommendation systems and the hype around the NetFlix competition has made recommender systems a major topic in data mining. In this course we will learn about different aspects of recommender systems with particular emphasis on its algorithms.",
