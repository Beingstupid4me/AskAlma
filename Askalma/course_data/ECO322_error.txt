Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format as per the user's instructions. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: They are both "ECO 322/522" and "Econometrics II". So I'll assign those directly to their respective fields.

Next, Credits: The value is consistently 4, so that's straightforward. 

For the Course Offered To section, it mentions both UG and PG, but since all rows say "UG/PG", I can just list that as a single entry under "UG/PG".

The Course Description seems lengthy and repetitive across multiple rows. Since it's the same each time, I'll include it once in the description field.

Looking at the Prerequisites section: The only mandatory prerequisite is listed on row 8. So I'll extract that into the Mandatory Prerequisite field.

For Course Outcomes (COs), there are five rows with CO1 to CO4. Each CO has a description, and some have additional details like "Additionally..." or "Students will be able to...". I need to structure each CO with its respective description, making sure to handle any additional text appropriately.

The Weekly Lecture Plan is spread across multiple weeks (Week 1-2 up to Week 23). Each week has a lecture topic and the COs met. However, in row 14, there's an assignment listed under "Assignment/Labs/Tutorial", which might be outside the weekly plan structure. I'll note that as a potential issue but proceed with extracting the COs for each week.

The Assessment Plan includes Quiz/Assignments (25%), Project (25%), Midsem (20%), and Endsem (30%). These are straightforward to map into their respective fields.

Resource Material has three references: a book by Cheng Hsiao, another by Cameron and Trivedi, and one by William Greene. I'll list each as an object with type and title.

I need to ensure that all missing values are handled gracefully, using empty strings or null where necessary. For example, if any field doesn't have data, it should be represented appropriately in the JSON.

Finally, I must structure everything into a single JSON object without any introductory text or markdown formatting.

  "Course Description": "This course will provide training in advanced applied econometrics through two (broad) modules: A) Panel Data Analysis; and B) Microeconometrics. Panel data (or longitudinal data) run over time and for different observation units like individuals, households, firms, regions, countries, etc. The repeated nature of the individual-level data enables more realistic econometric modeling (e.g., incorporating dynamics at the individual level); more robust estimation methods (e.g., controlling for unobserved heterogeneity) and more powerful statistical inference procedures (e.g. testing for longrun purchasing power parity by pooling a number of countries). We will study the development of the linear regression model in panel data settings involving 'fixed' and 'random' effects, and the statistical properties of the relevant estimators. Microeconometrics is the study of economic behavior of individuals or firms b y employing micro-level discrete response data and regression methods for panel data. The purpose of this module is to expose students to powerful econometric techniques frequently used in applied microeconomic research and quantitative policy analysis.",
