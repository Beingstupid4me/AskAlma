  "Course Code": "CSE506",
  "Course Name": "Data Mining",
  "Credits": "4",
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "Data mining aims at finding the useful patterns in large data sets. Interest in the field is motivated by the growth of computerized data collection due to ubiquity of Internet enabled devices. This course will cover a set of techniques designed to be used for finding interesting patterns from the data. The techniques include classification, clustering, association rule mining and sequence mining. Students will learn and use the open source R statistical software, see http://www.r-project.org, and machine learning packages such as Weka in this course.",
