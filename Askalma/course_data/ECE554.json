  "Course Description": "This is a senior UG / PG level course on Compressed Sensing. Compressed Sensing (CS) is most talked about topic in signal processing today and is taught in all the top universities across the world. CS is the study of under-determined linear inverse problems where the solution is typically a lower dimensional many fold embedded in a higher dimensional space. The most prominent examples being - a sparse solution or a low-rank solution. Today compressed sensing permeates not only signal processing and applied maths but also encompasses a variety of topics in machine learning and computer vision. This course is open to both CS and ECE students.",
