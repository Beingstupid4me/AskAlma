  "Course Name": "Multimedia Security",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG",
  "Course Description": "Media Security course introduces the multimedia fundamentals and security related issues such as rights protection, authentication, traitor tracing, forensics, adversarial signal processing, covert communication and surveillance. Overview of different aspects of multimedia security and compression techniques, architectures and standards will be discussed. Some of the course topics are information hiding and its applications, media compression, robustness analysis, encryption, passive forensics, source identification, multimedia signatures and egocentric video forensics, adversarial signal processing, Discrete Fourier/Wavelet Transform, electrical network frequency estimation, visual surveillance, steganography and steganalysis.",
