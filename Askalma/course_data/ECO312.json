  "Course Name": "Industrial Organization (IO)",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": [
    "UG",
    "PG"
  ],
  "Course Description": "This course will introduce basic theoretical models of IO. It will implement applied microeconomics theory and game theory to understand how firms take decisions in various settings. The models include profit maximization when there is market power, advertising, heterogeneity in quality, vertical control, models of entry, accommodation and exit, and many others. The course helps one understand how to set up an objective function for a firm facing different challenges in a complex market structure. It will aid the student in understanding real world scenarios. Finally there will also be a short section on some empirical methods used in IO.",
