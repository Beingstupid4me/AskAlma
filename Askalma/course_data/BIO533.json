  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG/PG - Core",
  "Course Description": "This course introduces systems and synthetic biology to students with interest in applying mathematical techniques to biological problem. The main aim of this course is to train students to build mathematical models of complex biological systems and make predictions about the functions of the biological systems in-silico under various conditions. They will also learn conditions to build synthetic circuit in-silico to optimize its functions under various scenarios.",
