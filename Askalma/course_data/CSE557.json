  "Course Description": "Distributed processing frameworks have emerged as a feasible and cost effective way of analyzing the increasing volume of data. This course provides an understanding of most popular distributed processing frameworks \u2013 Hadoop, Spark and Giraph. Example Applications will include Graph Analysis algorithms such as BFS, Page Rank, Finding Graph Patterns; Finding Similar Items, Mining Algorithms such as Clustering, Frequent Itemsets, Data Streams. Hands-on exercises will prepare those taking this course to be able to apply these frameworks in practice.",
