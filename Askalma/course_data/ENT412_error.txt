Alright, I need to extract information from the provided file content and structure it into a specific JSON format. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Course Code and Name: both are listed as "ENT412" and "Entrepreneurial Khichadi". So those fields will be straightforward.

Next, Credits: The value is 4, which is already a number, so that's easy to include.

Course Offered To has multiple entries. I'll need to list each one separately under the "Offered to" key. It includes B.Tech., M.Tech., and Ph.D. students.

The Course Description is quite lengthy but doesn't contain any special characters like commas or line breaks, so it can be included as a single string.

For Prerequisites, I see three sections: Mandatory, Desirable, and Other. Each has "None None None", so I'll map those accordingly.

Moving on to Course Outcomes (COs), there are four COs listed with their respective numbers. That's straightforward.

The Weekly Lecture Plan is a bit more complex. It starts from Week 1 to Week 28, each week having a Lecture Topic and COs Met. However, the last two weeks only have the Lecture Topic without Assignments or COs. I'll need to handle that by leaving those fields empty for Weeks 25-28.

Assessment Plan includes Quiz exams, Midsem, HW assignments, and Endsem with percentages. The file shows Midsem as "Midsem" but doesn't specify a percentage, so it's marked as null. The rest have values or are marked as null if not provided.

Resource Material has two Textbooks: "Innovation and Entreprenuership" by Peter F. Drucker (desirable) and "The Lean startup" by Eric Ries (also desirable). There's no optional textbook, so the "Title" field will be empty for that key.

I need to ensure all fields are correctly named and data types are handled properlyâ€”numbers should stay as numbers, others as strings. Also, missing values should be represented as null or empty strings where appropriate.
