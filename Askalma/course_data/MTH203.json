  "Course Name": "Mathematics III (Multivariate Calculus)",
  "Credits": 4,
  "Course Offered to": "UG",
  "Course Description": "This course covers topics in multivariable calculus, vector calculus and complex analysis. The course starts with an extension of concepts like limits, continuity and differentiation to functions of several variables. Partial differentiation is defined and applied. The idea of Taylor series is extended to functions of two variables. This is followed by a definition and application of integration in more than one dimensions: double and triple integrals. We then work with vector functions and develop the ideas of vector fields and differentiation and integration as applicable to vector calculus (gradient, divergence, curl, line and surface integrals, etc. The ideas of circulation and flux are developed and Green's, Stoke's and divergence theorems are covered. The final module of the course deals with complex numbers and functions and an extension of concepts of calculus to complex variables.",
