  "Credits": "4",
  "Course Offered to": "UG",
  "Course Description": "With the digital social data growing at an accelerated pace on an everyday basis, there is an urgent need for social researchers to decrypt, examine and interpret this unusually large-scale complex data fill. Doing this systemically will not only help in deciphering and understanding the social world we live in but will also help strategically combat the complex challenges of the contemporary social world. With a growing demand for such skills both in the academic and the commercial sectors, this course anchored in sociology and anthropology will provide the learners an objective view of social data issues viz. reliability, replicability, reproducibility, validity and generalizability of the data and the associated methods.",
