As India strives to achieve sustainable development goals, human -centered computing becomes increasingly important in developing technology solutions that holistically support human activities in healthcare, education, women\u2019s safety, and others.\nHCC's aim is to create technology solutions at the center of the design process. As computi ng solutions are increasingly becoming a part of everyday life, there is an increasing need for  developing solutions that support the user. Human dependence on computing solutions is no longer optional but an unavoidable necessity.\nThe impact of HCC has been visible in almost every sector where technology has a direct interface with humans. The HCC will provide the necessary framework for developing intelligent solutions supporting human activities and enhancing human capability. To develop more innovative  social -technical solutions  in various domains, there is a pressi ng need to promote research activities in the HCC domain.\nMost of the current -day technology solutions have been developed in the West (as per the need s of western users) and then are imported. Exper ts of human -cent ered Computing believe that computer visualization , human -robot interaction, mixed reality systems, and mobile and ubiquitous computing, etc., will integrate HCC research.\nHCC is a combination of  human -computer interaction , design, and social sciences. The purpose is to develop computing systems for humans in such a way that they support human endeavour without requiring efforts to learn.
